        "summary": "The Supreme Court allowed Trump to move forward with dismantling the Education Department and laying off nearly half its staff. In an unsigned order, the justices lifted a lower court ruling that had paused the plan and required the reinstatement of about 1,400 employees. The department had over 4,000 employees before Trump returned to office, but his cuts would leave it with about half that number \u2013 part of a broader effort to shut down the agency without congressional approval. Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the decision \"indefensible\" and said the court was enabling Trump's \"intent to break the law\" by giving him \"the power to repeal statutes by firing all those necessary to carry them out.\" From the same link: \nA group of 24 states and Washington, D.C., sued the Trump administration for withholding $6.8 billion in education funding due July 1. The lawsuit says the freeze violates the Constitution, the Impoundment Control Act, and other laws by blocking money Congress approved for after-school care, teacher training, and programs for migrant children and English learners.\n\nFrom CBS:\nIn a complaint in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, lawyers for the states said the decision to freeze the funds had caused \"chaos.\" The suit named as defendants Education Secretary Linda McMahon, President Trump and Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget. \"States already have planned for the upcoming academic year \u2014 which is set to start in weeks in many areas \u2014 in reliance on the billions of dollars that are now frozen,\" they wrote. \"The budgets for many local educational agencies (LEAs) have already been approved and staffing plans have been developed so that LEAs can perform their responsibilities for the impacted programs.\"\n\nFrom Paul Krugman:\nYou've probably heard that the One Big Beautiful Bill will cause immense hardship via its cuts to Medicaid, which will amount to around 15 percent of the program's spending. Well, the Trump administration wants to cut funding for NOAA by 40 percent. Since NOAA is a tiny budget item compared with Medicaid, what's this about? Actually, there's no mystery. Among other things, NOAA research helps us understand and predict climate change, and America's right is firmly committed to climate denial. So Trump officials want to end research that might tell them things they don't want to hear.\n\nWhy not eliminate only research directly focused on climate change? Because that's not how it works. When you have a pervasive phenomenon like climate change just about any research into the weather will provide evidence that it's happening. So the MAGA/Project 2025 solution is to stop almost all research.\n\nThe same logic lies behind the drastic cuts at the National Institutes of Health: They aren't about saving money, they're about preventing researchers from discovering things \u2014 like evidence that vaccines work and are safe \u2014 that don't match the prejudices of the people in charge.\n\nSo Trump's cuts to scientific research aren't about shrinking government and saving money. They're about dealing with possibly inconvenient evidence by covering the nation's ears and shouting \"La, la, la, we can't hear you.\"\n\nWill the war on science hurt America? Massively. As I said, estimating the benefits of NOAA research is tricky. But two first-rate economists, David Cutler and Ed Glaeser, have made a stab at estimating the impact of cuts at NIH. Their analysis suggests that these cuts might save $500 billion in federal spending over the next 25 years \u2014 while imposing more than $8 trillion in losses.\n\nBut don't expect studies like these to change policy. America is now run by people who believe that knowledge is dangerous, and ignorance is strength.",
