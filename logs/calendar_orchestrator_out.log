I've researched and sent you a comprehensive analysis of the subtle skills required for transitioning from a data scientist/senior IC/tech lead role to management at companies like Microsoft. The email covers the deeper, less obvious aspects including political navigation, mental model shifts, company-specific cultural nuances, and the hidden challenges that most surface-level advice doesn't address.

(2) Do the mathematical concepts actually connect logically? (3) Are experimental claims backed by proper methodology? (4) Does the writing prioritize substance over jargon?

What would convincing evidence look like?
