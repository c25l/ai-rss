I've researched and sent you a comprehensive analysis of the subtle skills required for transitioning from a data scientist/senior IC/tech lead role to management at companies like Microsoft. The email covers the deeper, less obvious aspects including political navigation, mental model shifts, company-specific cultural nuances, and the hidden challenges that most surface-level advice doesn't address.

(2) Do the mathematical concepts actually connect logically? (3) Are experimental claims backed by proper methodology? (4) Does the writing prioritize substance over jargon?

Don\'t wait until the end - update and refine your recommendations as you discover better papers in later batches.\n\n2. **Quality Analysis & Crackpot Filtering**: For each batch, apply rigorous skeptical review:\n\n**Core Quality Criteria:**\n(1) Is the central claim testable and precisely stated? \n(2) Do the mathematical concepts actually connect logically? \n(3) Are experimental claims backed by proper methodology? \n(4) Does the writing prioritize substance over jargon?\n\n**CRACKPOT WARNING SIGNS - IMMEDIATE REJECTION:**\n- **Grand Unification Claims**: Papers claiming to unify disparate fields under one simple equation/framework without rigorous validation\n- **Revolutionary Breakthrough Language**: Excessive use of "breakthrough," "revolutionary," "paradigm shift" without proportional evidence\n- **Vague Mathematical Formalism**: Mathematical notation that looks impressive but doesn\'t serve a clear logical purpose\n- **Missing Baselines/Comparisons**: Experimental claims without proper controls or baseline comparisons\n- **Theory of Everything Syndrome**: Attempting to explain too much with too little evidence\n- **Buzzword Bingo**: Terminology salad mixing unrelated trending fields (quantum + AI + consciousness, etc.)\n- **AI Tool Acknowledgments**: Papers prominently crediting AI tools for core contributions\n\n**REJECT IMMEDIATELY**: Any paper that reads like a "theory of everything" or claims universal laws without extraordinary evidence.\n\n3. **Progressive Refinement Strategy**:\n- Start with top papers from first batch\n- As you find better papers in later batches, replace weaker selections\n- Maintain a running "best of" list that evolves\n- **Apply crackpot filter at each step** - better to have fewer high-quality papers than include questionable work\n- Final digest should represent the absolute best from ALL papers, not just early ones\n\n4. **Research Preferences**: Use "/Users/chris/source/airss/research_interests_analysis.md" and "/Users/chris/source/airss/zotero_library_export.csv" to customize selection.\n\n5. **Output Format**: \n- Abstract links: https://arxiv.org/abs/<identifier>\n- HTML versions: https://arxiv.org/html/<identifier>\n- Include total papers analyzed (e.g., "Analyzed 83 of 83 total papers")\n- **Flag any questionable papers you filtered out** for transparency\n\n6. **Final Step**: Deliver complete digest to outbox via MCP outbox:send only after analyzing ALL available papers.\n\nEvent Schedule: Recurring daily around 21:00-23:00 UTC (15 minute duration)', 'Start': datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 28, 1, 0), 'End': datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 28, 1, 15)}]

Don\'t wait until the end - update and refine your recommendations as you discover better papers in later batches.\n\n2. **Quality Analysis & Crackpot Filtering**: For each batch, apply rigorous skeptical review:\n\n**Core Quality Criteria:**\n(1) Is the central claim testable and precisely stated? \n(2) Do the mathematical concepts actually connect logically? \n(3) Are experimental claims backed by proper methodology? \n(4) Does the writing prioritize substance over jargon?\n\n**CRACKPOT WARNING SIGNS - IMMEDIATE REJECTION:**\n- **Grand Unification Claims**: Papers claiming to unify disparate fields under one simple equation/framework without rigorous validation\n- **Revolutionary Breakthrough Language**: Excessive use of "breakthrough," "revolutionary," "paradigm shift" without proportional evidence\n- **Vague Mathematical Formalism**: Mathematical notation that looks impressive but doesn\'t serve a clear logical purpose\n- **Missing Baselines/Comparisons**: Experimental claims without proper controls or baseline comparisons\n- **Theory of Everything Syndrome**: Attempting to explain too much with too little evidence\n- **Buzzword Bingo**: Terminology salad mixing unrelated trending fields (quantum + AI + consciousness, etc.)\n- **AI Tool Acknowledgments**: Papers prominently crediting AI tools for core contributions\n\n**REJECT IMMEDIATELY**: Any paper that reads like a "theory of everything" or claims universal laws without extraordinary evidence.\n\n3. **Progressive Refinement Strategy**:\n- Start with top papers from first batch\n- As you find better papers in later batches, replace weaker selections\n- Maintain a running "best of" list that evolves\n- **Apply crackpot filter at each step** - better to have fewer high-quality papers than include questionable work\n- Final digest should represent the absolute best from ALL papers, not just early ones\n\n4. **Research Preferences**: Use "/Users/chris/source/airss/research_interests_analysis.md" and "/Users/chris/source/airss/zotero_library_export.csv" to customize selection.\n\n5. **Output Format**: \n- Abstract links: https://arxiv.org/abs/<identifier>\n- HTML versions: https://arxiv.org/html/<identifier>\n- Include total papers analyzed (e.g., "Analyzed 83 of 83 total papers")\n- **Flag any questionable papers you filtered out** for transparency\n\n6. **Final Step**: Deliver complete digest to outbox via MCP outbox:send only after analyzing ALL available papers.\n\nEvent Schedule: Recurring daily around 21:00-23:00 UTC (15 minute duration)', 'Start': datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 29, 1, 0), 'End': datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 29, 1, 15)}]

Don\'t wait until the end - update and refine your recommendations as you discover better papers in later batches.\n\n2. **Quality Analysis & Crackpot Filtering**: For each batch, apply rigorous skeptical review:\n\n**Core Quality Criteria:**\n(1) Is the central claim testable and precisely stated? \n(2) Do the mathematical concepts actually connect logically? \n(3) Are experimental claims backed by proper methodology? \n(4) Does the writing prioritize substance over jargon?\n\n**CRACKPOT WARNING SIGNS - IMMEDIATE REJECTION:**\n- **Grand Unification Claims**: Papers claiming to unify disparate fields under one simple equation/framework without rigorous validation\n- **Revolutionary Breakthrough Language**: Excessive use of "breakthrough," "revolutionary," "paradigm shift" without proportional evidence\n- **Vague Mathematical Formalism**: Mathematical notation that looks impressive but doesn\'t serve a clear logical purpose\n- **Missing Baselines/Comparisons**: Experimental claims without proper controls or baseline comparisons\n- **Theory of Everything Syndrome**: Attempting to explain too much with too little evidence\n- **Buzzword Bingo**: Terminology salad mixing unrelated trending fields (quantum + AI + consciousness, etc.)\n- **AI Tool Acknowledgments**: Papers prominently crediting AI tools for core contributions\n\n**REJECT IMMEDIATELY**: Any paper that reads like a "theory of everything" or claims universal laws without extraordinary evidence.\n\n3. **Progressive Refinement Strategy**:\n- Start with top papers from first batch\n- As you find better papers in later batches, replace weaker selections\n- Maintain a running "best of" list that evolves\n- **Apply crackpot filter at each step** - better to have fewer high-quality papers than include questionable work\n- Final digest should represent the absolute best from ALL papers, not just early ones\n\n4. **Research Preferences**: Use "/Users/chris/source/airss/research_interests_analysis.md" and "/Users/chris/source/airss/zotero_library_export.csv" to customize selection.\n\n5. **Output Format**: \n- Abstract links: https://arxiv.org/abs/<identifier>\n- HTML versions: https://arxiv.org/html/<identifier>\n- Include total papers analyzed (e.g., "Analyzed 83 of 83 total papers")\n- **Flag any questionable papers you filtered out** for transparency\n\n6. **Final Step**: Deliver complete digest to outbox via MCP outbox:send only after analyzing ALL available papers.\n\nEvent Schedule: Recurring daily around 21:00-23:00 UTC (15 minute duration)', 'Start': datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 1, 1, 0), 'End': datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 1, 1, 15)}]

Don\'t wait until the end - update and refine your recommendations as you discover better papers in later batches.\n\n2. **Quality Analysis & Crackpot Filtering**: For each batch, apply rigorous skeptical review:\n\n**Core Quality Criteria:**\n(1) Is the central claim testable and precisely stated? \n(2) Do the mathematical concepts actually connect logically? \n(3) Are experimental claims backed by proper methodology? \n(4) Does the writing prioritize substance over jargon?\n\n**CRACKPOT WARNING SIGNS - IMMEDIATE REJECTION:**\n- **Grand Unification Claims**: Papers claiming to unify disparate fields under one simple equation/framework without rigorous validation\n- **Revolutionary Breakthrough Language**: Excessive use of "breakthrough," "revolutionary," "paradigm shift" without proportional evidence\n- **Vague Mathematical Formalism**: Mathematical notation that looks impressive but doesn\'t serve a clear logical purpose\n- **Missing Baselines/Comparisons**: Experimental claims without proper controls or baseline comparisons\n- **Theory of Everything Syndrome**: Attempting to explain too much with too little evidence\n- **Buzzword Bingo**: Terminology salad mixing unrelated trending fields (quantum + AI + consciousness, etc.)\n- **AI Tool Acknowledgments**: Papers prominently crediting AI tools for core contributions\n\n**REJECT IMMEDIATELY**: Any paper that reads like a "theory of everything" or claims universal laws without extraordinary evidence.\n\n3. **Progressive Refinement Strategy**:\n- Start with top papers from first batch\n- As you find better papers in later batches, replace weaker selections\n- Maintain a running "best of" list that evolves\n- **Apply crackpot filter at each step** - better to have fewer high-quality papers than include questionable work\n- Final digest should represent the absolute best from ALL papers, not just early ones\n\n4. **Research Preferences**: Use "/Users/chris/source/airss/research_interests_analysis.md" and "/Users/chris/source/airss/zotero_library_export.csv" to customize selection.\n\n5. **Output Format**: \n- Abstract links: https://arxiv.org/abs/<identifier>\n- HTML versions: https://arxiv.org/html/<identifier>\n- Include total papers analyzed (e.g., "Analyzed 83 of 83 total papers")\n- **Flag any questionable papers you filtered out** for transparency\n\n6. **Final Step**: Deliver complete digest to outbox via MCP outbox:send only after analyzing ALL available papers.\n\nEvent Schedule: Recurring daily around 21:00-23:00 UTC (15 minute duration)', 'Start': datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 4, 1, 0), 'End': datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 4, 1, 15)}]

Today\'s schedule \n2. Next week\'s upcoming personal calendar events except work start/end\n3. Next week\'s multi-day or evening events on the shara calendar\n4. Recent Obsidian materials from the past week if available\n5. Open todos from Obsidian via: `mcp__obsidian-mcp__obsidian_complex_search` with query `{"regexp": ["- \\\\[ \\\\]", {"var": "content"}]}`\n\nReview these materials and integrate them into a personal status briefing. Focus on identifying items that may need attention, follow-up, or preparation. Draft as a factual status report without summary or reflection sections, then send via the outbox MCP server.\n\n## Task 3: News Briefing\n\nGenerate and send a news intelligence brief. Abstract away stressful details and avoid partisan US politics, Israel, Trump, sports, music, or performances.\n\n### Article Collection:\n```javascript\nlocal_and_world_news = get_articles({"feeds":["https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/US.xml",\n"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml",\n"https://www.theatlantic.com/feed/all/",\n"https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/feed"]})\n\ncultural_interest = get_articles({"feeds":["https://rss.metafilter.com/metafilter.rss",\n"https://acoup.blog/feed/"]})\n\nai_articles = get_articles({"feeds": ["https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/feed/",\n"https://www.nature.com/nature.rss",\n"https://tldr.tech/api/rss/ai"]}) // scrape tldr-ai newsletter URI for contents\n\nlocal = get_articles({"feeds":["https://www.longmontleader.com/rss/","https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont.rss"]})\n```\n\n### Newsletter Requirements:\n- Synthesize articles into coherent narrative sections\n- Create engaging headlines and stories that connect related articles\n- Use markdown formatting with inline links: [article title](url)\n- Write as a complete intelligence brief\n- Include sections for: US/world news, cultural interest, AI news, local Longmont news\n- Create engaging, coherent narratives that connect related articles\n- Write concise but informative content suitable for daily intelligence brief\n- Focus on meaningful analysis and context between stories\n\nDeliver the markdown content to the outbox via MCP outbox:send.\n\n## Task 4: Bluesky Activity Summary\n\nUse MCP to collect today\'s activity on bluesky timeline. Summarize the activity into themes with links to linked articles as appropriate. Deliver this summary to the MCP outbox:send.\n\n## Task 5: Arxiv Digest\n\n### Progressive Paper Analysis:\nSystematically traverse ALL papers from the last day, building analysis progressively:\n\n**Step 1 - Get first batch:**\n```javascript\nget_articles({"feeds":["https://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs.AI+cs.LG"], "days_back": 1, "limit": 20, "offset": 0})\n```\n\n**Step 2 - Continue through all batches:**\nKeep paginating through ALL available papers, building digest progressively:\n```javascript\nget_articles({"feeds":["https://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs.AI+cs.LG"], "days_back": 1, "limit": 20, "offset": 20})\nget_articles({"feeds":["https://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs.AI+cs.LG"], "days_back": 1, "limit": 20, "offset": 40})\n// Continue until has_more: false\n```\n\n**Important**: Build digest article PROGRESSIVELY as you traverse each batch. Don\'t wait until the end - update and refine recommendations as you discover better papers in later batches.\n\n### Quality Analysis & Crackpot Filtering:\nFor each batch, apply rigorous skeptical review:\n\n**Core Quality Criteria:**\n1. Is the central claim testable and precisely stated? \n2. Do the mathematical concepts actually connect logically? \n3. Are experimental claims backed by proper methodology? \n4. Does the writing prioritize substance over jargon?\n\n**CRACKPOT WARNING SIGNS - IMMEDIATE REJECTION:**\n- **Grand Unification Claims**: Papers claiming to unify disparate fields under one simple equation/framework without rigorous validation\n- **Revolutionary Breakthrough Language**: Excessive use of "breakthrough," "revolutionary," "paradigm shift" without proportional evidence\n- **Vague Mathematical Formalism**: Mathematical notation that looks impressive but doesn\'t serve a clear logical purpose\n- **Missing Baselines/Comparisons**: Experimental claims without proper controls or baseline comparisons\n- **Theory of Everything Syndrome**: Attempting to explain too much with too little evidence\n- **Buzzword Bingo**: Terminology salad mixing unrelated trending fields (quantum + AI + consciousness, etc.)\n- **AI Tool Acknowledgments**: Papers prominently crediting AI tools for core contributions\n\n**REJECT IMMEDIATELY**: Any paper that reads like a "theory of everything" or claims universal laws without extraordinary evidence.\n\n### Progressive Refinement Strategy:\n- Start with top papers from first batch\n- As you find better papers in later batches, replace weaker selections\n- Maintain a running "best of" list that evolves\n- Apply crackpot filter at each step - better to have fewer high-quality papers than include questionable work\n- Final digest should represent the absolute best from ALL papers, not just early ones\n\n### Research Preferences:\nUse `/Users/chris/source/airss/research_interests_analysis.md` and `/Users/chris/source/airss/zotero_library_export.csv` to customize selection.\n\n### Output Format:\n- Abstract links: https://arxiv.org/abs/<identifier>\n- HTML versions: https://arxiv.org/html/<identifier>\n- Include total papers analyzed (e.g., "Analyzed 83 of 83 total papers")\n- Flag any questionable papers you filtered out for transparency\n\n### Final Step:\nDeliver complete digest to outbox via MCP outbox:send only after analyzing ALL available papers.\n\n---\n\n## Execution Notes:\n- Execute tasks in chronological order\n- Each task outputs to the MCP outbox:send when specified\n- Use proper timezone conversions (PT→MT) where needed\n- Apply rigorous quality filters, especially for arxiv digest\n- Focus on actionable intelligence rather than summaries', 'Start': datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 4, 11, 0), 'End': datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 4, 11, 15)}]

Today\'s schedule \n2. Next week\'s upcoming personal calendar events except work start/end\n3. Next week\'s multi-day or evening events on the shara calendar\n4. Recent Obsidian materials from the past week if available\n5. Open todos from Obsidian via: `mcp__obsidian-mcp__obsidian_complex_search` with query `{"regexp": ["- \\\\[ \\\\]", {"var": "content"}]}`\n\nReview these materials and integrate them into a personal status briefing. Focus on identifying items that may need attention, follow-up, or preparation. Draft as a factual status report without summary or reflection sections, then send via the outbox MCP server.\n\n## Task 3: News Briefing\n\nGenerate and send a news intelligence brief. Abstract away stressful details and avoid partisan US politics, Israel, Trump, sports, music, or performances.\n\n### Article Collection:\n```javascript\nlocal_and_world_news = get_articles({"feeds":["https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/US.xml",\n"https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml",\n"https://www.theatlantic.com/feed/all/",\n"https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/feed"]})\n\ncultural_interest = get_articles({"feeds":["https://rss.metafilter.com/metafilter.rss",\n"https://acoup.blog/feed/"]})\n\nai_articles = get_articles({"feeds": ["https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/feed/",\n"https://www.nature.com/nature.rss",\n"https://tldr.tech/api/rss/ai"]}) // scrape tldr-ai newsletter URI for contents\n\nlocal = get_articles({"feeds":["https://www.longmontleader.com/rss/","https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont.rss"]})\n```\n\n### Newsletter Requirements:\n- Synthesize articles into coherent narrative sections\n- Create engaging headlines and stories that connect related articles\n- Use markdown formatting with inline links: [article title](url)\n- Write as a complete intelligence brief\n- Include sections for: US/world news, cultural interest, AI news, local Longmont news\n- Create engaging, coherent narratives that connect related articles\n- Write concise but informative content suitable for daily intelligence brief\n- Focus on meaningful analysis and context between stories\n\nDeliver the markdown content to the outbox via MCP outbox:send.\n\n## Task 4: Bluesky Activity Summary\n\nUse MCP to collect today\'s activity on bluesky timeline. Summarize the activity into themes with links to linked articles as appropriate. Deliver this summary to the MCP outbox:send.\n\n## Task 5: Arxiv Digest\n\n### Progressive Paper Analysis:\nSystematically traverse ALL papers from the last day, building analysis progressively:\n\n**Step 1 - Get first batch:**\n```javascript\nget_articles({"feeds":["https://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs.AI+cs.LG"], "days_back": 1, "limit": 20, "offset": 0})\n```\n\n**Step 2 - Continue through all batches:**\nKeep paginating through ALL available papers, building digest progressively:\n```javascript\nget_articles({"feeds":["https://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs.AI+cs.LG"], "days_back": 1, "limit": 20, "offset": 20})\nget_articles({"feeds":["https://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs.AI+cs.LG"], "days_back": 1, "limit": 20, "offset": 40})\n// Continue until has_more: false\n```\n\n**Important**: Build digest article PROGRESSIVELY as you traverse each batch. Don\'t wait until the end - update and refine recommendations as you discover better papers in later batches.\n\n### Quality Analysis & Crackpot Filtering:\nFor each batch, apply rigorous skeptical review:\n\n**Core Quality Criteria:**\n1. Is the central claim testable and precisely stated? \n2. Do the mathematical concepts actually connect logically? \n3. Are experimental claims backed by proper methodology? \n4. Does the writing prioritize substance over jargon?\n\n**CRACKPOT WARNING SIGNS - IMMEDIATE REJECTION:**\n- **Grand Unification Claims**: Papers claiming to unify disparate fields under one simple equation/framework without rigorous validation\n- **Revolutionary Breakthrough Language**: Excessive use of "breakthrough," "revolutionary," "paradigm shift" without proportional evidence\n- **Vague Mathematical Formalism**: Mathematical notation that looks impressive but doesn\'t serve a clear logical purpose\n- **Missing Baselines/Comparisons**: Experimental claims without proper controls or baseline comparisons\n- **Theory of Everything Syndrome**: Attempting to explain too much with too little evidence\n- **Buzzword Bingo**: Terminology salad mixing unrelated trending fields (quantum + AI + consciousness, etc.)\n- **AI Tool Acknowledgments**: Papers prominently crediting AI tools for core contributions\n\n**REJECT IMMEDIATELY**: Any paper that reads like a "theory of everything" or claims universal laws without extraordinary evidence.\n\n### Progressive Refinement Strategy:\n- Start with top papers from first batch\n- As you find better papers in later batches, replace weaker selections\n- Maintain a running "best of" list that evolves\n- Apply crackpot filter at each step - better to have fewer high-quality papers than include questionable work\n- Final digest should represent the absolute best from ALL papers, not just early ones\n\n### Research Preferences:\nUse `/Users/chris/source/airss/research_interests_analysis.md` and `/Users/chris/source/airss/zotero_library_export.csv` to customize selection.\n\n### Output Format:\n- Abstract links: https://arxiv.org/abs/<identifier>\n- HTML versions: https://arxiv.org/html/<identifier>\n- Include total papers analyzed (e.g., "Analyzed 83 of 83 total papers")\n- Flag any questionable papers you filtered out for transparency\n\n### Final Step:\nDeliver complete digest to outbox via MCP outbox:send only after analyzing ALL available papers.\n\n---\n\n## Execution Notes:\n- Execute tasks in chronological order\n- Each task outputs to the MCP outbox:send when specified\n- Use proper timezone conversions (PT→MT) where needed\n- Apply rigorous quality filters, especially for arxiv digest\n- Focus on actionable intelligence rather than summaries', 'Start': datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 5, 11, 0), 'End': datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 5, 11, 15)}]

Description: # AI Orchestrator Master Prompt - Daily Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: Use mcp__outbox__add after completing each task below, then mcp__outbox__send_all at the end.

Execute these tasks in order, adding each completed section to the outbox:

## Task 1: Calendar Boundary Creator

Create Start and End events on the Personal calendar based on work calendar meetings.

### Steps:
1. **Fetch Chris@work calendar**: Use `mcp__calendar__list_events` to get events from the next 10 weekdays
2. **Filter work events**: Look for busy/tentative meetings (ignore all-day, declined, and free events)
3. If the calendar is marked as out of office, that start time should be taken as the end of the day. If the out of office events cover the whole day, ignore the day and move on.
4. If the day does not have start or end events on the personal calendar, simply move on to the next day 
5. **Move Start boundaries**: For each weekday, use the calendar mcp to update the "Start" events as follows:
   - Time: First meeting's start time OR 10:00 AM MDT (whichever is EARLIER)
   - Duration: 1 hour
   - Calendar: "Personal"
6. **Move End boundaries**: For each weekday, use the calendar mcp to update the "End" events as follows:
   - Time: Last meeting's end time OR 5:00 PM MDT (whichever is LATER)
   - Duration: 1 hour
   - Calendar: "Personal"

### Available Calendars:
- Personal calendar for boundary events
- Work calendar contains imported Google Calendar meetings
- Use `mcp__ical__list_calendars` to see all options

### Output Requirements:
- Report today's start and end times and whether the task was successful
- Use `mcp__outbox__add` with content:
```markdown
# Calendar Boundaries - [DATE]

## Today's Schedule
- Start: [TIME]
- End: [TIME]
- Status: [SUCCESS/FAILED]
```

## Task 2: Personal Summary

Add a personal status update by gathering information from multiple sources.

### Data Collection:
1. Today's schedule via `mcp__ical__list_events` 
2. Next week's upcoming personal calendar events (except work start/end)
3. Next week's multi-day or evening events on the shara calendar
4. Recent Obsidian materials from the past week as available
5. Open todos from Obsidian via: `mcp__obsidian-mcp__obsidian_complex_search` with query `{"regexp": ["- \\[ \\]", {"var": "content"}]}`

### Output Requirements:
- Review materials and integrate into a factual status briefing
- Focus on items needing attention, follow-up, or preparation
- Use `mcp__outbox__add` with content:
```markdown
## Personal Status Update

### This Week's Key Items
[Today's important items]

### Upcoming Week
[Next week's notable events and commitments]

### Action Items
[Open todos and items requiring attention]

### Recent Activity
[Relevant Obsidian materials from past week]
```

## Task 3: News Briefing

Generate news intelligence brief from RSS sources.

### Article Collection (use mcp__rss-feeds__get_articles):
- `local_and_world_news`: feeds `["https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/US.xml", "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml", "https://www.theatlantic.com/feed/all/", "https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/feed"]`
- `cultural_interest`: feeds `["https://rss.metafilter.com/metafilter.rss", "https://acoup.blog/feed/"]`
- `ai_articles`: feeds `["https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/feed/", "https://www.nature.com/nature.rss", "https://tldr.tech/api/rss/ai"]`
- `local`: feeds `["https://www.longmontleader.com/rss/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont.rss"]`

### Content Guidelines:
- Filter out anything to do with Trump, Israel sports, music, performances
- Synthesize articles into coherent narrative sections
- Create engaging headlines connecting related articles
- Use markdown with inline links: [article title](url)

### Output Requirements:
- Use `mcp__outbox__add` with content:
```markdown
## News Intelligence Brief

### US & World News
[Synthesized narrative of major stories]

### Cultural & Society
[Interesting cultural developments and discussions]

### AI & Technology
[Relevant AI/tech developments]

### Local Longmont
[Local news and community updates]
```

## Task 4: ArXiv Digest

Progressive analysis of AI/ML papers from the last day.

### Paper Collection Strategy:
1. **Get first batch**: Use `mcp__rss-feeds__get_articles` with feeds `["https://export.arxiv.org/rss/cs.AI+cs.LG"]`, days_back: 1, limit: 20, offset: 0
2. **Continue pagination**: Keep getting batches with increasing offset (20, 40, 60...) until has_more: false
3. **Build progressively**: Update your recommendations as you discover better papers in later batches

### Quality Filtering (Apply Rigorous Standards):
**REJECT papers with these red flags:**
- Big claims without big evidence
- Vague mathematical formalism
- Missing baselines/comparisons
- Buzzword bingo (mixing unrelated trending fields)
- Prominent AI tool acknowledgments

**Accept only papers that:**
- Make testable, precisely stated claims
- Have logical mathematical connections
- Use proper experimental methodology
- Prioritize substance over jargon

**Research Preferences:**
machine learning and computational linguistics, large language models, embeddings, transformers, and statistical methodology. Particular interest in the theoretical foundations of AI systems, representation learning, and the intersection of computer science with statistical applications.

### Output Requirements:
- Use `mcp__outbox__add` with content:
```markdown
## ArXiv Research Digest

### Top Papers (Analyzed [X] of [Y] total papers)
[Best 3-5 papers with abstracts and analysis]

### Notable Mentions
[Additional interesting papers worth tracking]

### Research Trends
[Patterns observed across all papers]

```

## Final Execution:
After completing all 4 tasks above, use `mcp__outbox__send_all` to send the complete accumulated document.

## Notes:
- Execute tasks sequentially in the numbered order
- Use native macOS Calendar access via mcp-ical instead of Google Calendar MCP
- Apply timezone conversions (PT→MT) where needed
- Focus on actionable intelligence rather than summaries
- Each task should add meaningful content to build a comprehensive daily brief
