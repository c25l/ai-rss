# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

### 1. Implementation Guidelines
- Implement the agreed design without changing it mid-stream
- If you discover issues during implementation, stop and redesign rather than pivot silently
- Each component should have minimal, focused responsibilities
- Preserve existing working logic unless explicitly asked to replace it

### 2. When Uncertain
- Ask "Is this what you had in mind?" before major changes
- Propose alternatives: "We could do X or Y - which fits your vision?"
- Admit when you're not sure rather than guessing and pivoting later

**Goal**: Align on the mental model first, then implement that model faithfully.
