        "summary": "Slate Auto is an American startup company that is developing electric vehicles, scheduled for release to the market in late 2026.  Nothing startling there.  What is unusual about their offering is, in large part, the price point - with government rebates the base vehicle starts at USD20k (those rebates have to be at risk, of course because *waves around*).  The base vehicle, dubbed the 'Blank Slate' is an all-electric rear-wheel-drive two-door utility with two seats and a 120 mile (193 km) range.\n\nYoutube channel Rich Rebuilds take a close look at the vehicle here (42:57 YouTube video). The car can be optioned up with additional bolt-on panels to make it a 'fastback' or SUV with five seats, with these additions being made at a dealer level. One example of how they've kept the price point down is the lack of massive touch screens controlling bespoke audio, navigation and other functions.  Instead, a basic touch screen controls your own device via an app.  A big part of the approach, though, is 'reductive manufacturing', where the number of components are reduced to the minimum.  For example, the door armrests are interchangeable not only on all the doors, but the same part is used for the lid of the centre console.\n\nYou can have the car in any colour as long as it's grey, but it has been designed to be easily and cheaply wrapped, including the wheels.  Right to Repair has been a strong focus in the design, with composite body panels that can be removed and replaced with just a few screws or bolts as well as the intention to provide specifications and instructions to allow people to service and repair the car themselves.  Aftermarket additions are catered for by fixed 'access points' where accessories can be designed and made using manuals and CAD files to be released by the manufacturer.\n\nSlate Auto has been described as the 'anti-Tesla' and it's perhaps not a mistake that the name is an anagram of Tesla.  With an undisclosed level of funding coming from Jeff Bezos (among others), there's no doubt opinions will be mixed not just because the concept of a cheap, adaptable design has been tried before without much success, but the public perception of Bezos brings a variety of reactions.",

      "summary": "Slate Auto is an American startup company that is developing electric vehicles, scheduled for release to the market in late 2026.  Nothing startling there.  What is unusual about their offering is, in large part, the price point - with government rebates the base vehicle starts at USD20k (those rebates have to be at risk, of course because *waves around*).  The base vehicle, dubbed the 'Blank Slate' is an all-electric rear-wheel-drive two-door utility with two seats and a 120 mile (193 km) range.\n\nYoutube channel Rich Rebuilds take a close look at the vehicle here (42:57 YouTube video). The car can be optioned up with additional bolt-on panels to make it a 'fastback' or SUV with five seats, with these additions being made at a dealer level. One example of how they've kept the price point down is the lack of massive touch screens controlling bespoke audio, navigation and other functions.  Instead, a basic touch screen controls your own device via an app.  A big part of the approach, though, is 'reductive manufacturing', where the number of components are reduced to the minimum.  For example, the door armrests are interchangeable not only on all the doors, but the same part is used for the lid of the centre console.\n\nYou can have the car in any colour as long as it's grey, but it has been designed to be easily and cheaply wrapped, including the wheels.  Right to Repair has been a strong focus in the design, with composite body panels that can be removed and replaced with just a few screws or bolts as well as the intention to provide specifications and instructions to allow people to service and repair the car themselves.  Aftermarket additions are catered for by fixed 'access points' where accessories can be designed and made using manuals and CAD files to be released by the manufacturer.\n\nSlate Auto has been described as the 'anti-Tesla' and it's perhaps not a mistake that the name is an anagram of Tesla.  With an undisclosed level of funding coming from Jeff Bezos (among others), there's no doubt opinions will be mixed not just because the concept of a cheap, adaptable design has been tried before without much success, but the public perception of Bezos brings a variety of reactions.",
