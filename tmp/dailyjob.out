Previous theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of e...', 0.0], ['- [Topos Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08295)\n\t - arXiv:2508.08295v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, whi...', 1.0], ['- [An Efficient Application of Goal Programming to Tackle Multiobjective Problems with Recurring Fitness Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08297)\n\t - arXiv:2508.08297v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms.

# Recent Journal Entries

<br>

<br>
	- That needs to be a thing.
<br>

<br>
	- Questions today?
<br>

<br>
		- need to ask about how many ppl in org. 3 units, 10k total, 2k smallest.
<br>

<br>
		- what is the cultural issue? it's faster than ms people like typicaly.
<br>

<br>
		- what will the job likely consist of? A little more hectic, a little more myo impact. 
<br>

<br>
		- When do the meetings start and end? same as now.
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
-  The bot works! I needed to state-save from a different browser and then it was beautiful. Worked for several hours before I got tagged. I think this is how it's actually done. Hoping to step out of this workstream now. 
<br>

<br>
- it's... jittery. It's all jittery. That's fine too.
<br>

<br>
- the 0.6 b predictions were unstable? some trues and falses. Lots of instances. Like it doesn't understand. 
<br>

<br>
	- Just doing them with claude instead. Why not?
<br>

<br>
	- Can do this -> training data.
<br>

<br>
	- started today at maybe 1-2?
<br>

<br>
- Drawers bug me but they're so useful. I love the design and wind up foot-gunning with it all too frequently.
<br>

<br>
- Ben A meeting:
<br>

<br>
	- turned off 2nd monitor. Interesting for a test, at least.
<br>

<br>
	- He's a few late. 
<br>

<br>
	- good talk. Very candid. Very clear that he's not with ExP anymore.
<br>

<br>
- Yeah, hearing JR talk, it's clear to me that LTAE is doomed. There's a revenue crunch, and a drive to increase ad load. He feels defeated. There's no shame in being a rat, and leaving the ship as soon as it starts to sink.
<br>

<br>
	- I don't have to be proud of it. It's okay to not be.
<br>

<br>
- Need to embrace the ipad more, but without the controller.
<br>

<br>
- I see what it is. I see an aspect of it. I was able to experiment, experiments were king, but waning. I got to run one of the biggest A/B shops in the world. But, they're not going to be valuable anymore, because political power is being reconsolidated away. 
<br>

<br>
	- I will go then, away from experimentation, and do analytics and forecasting. 
<br>

<br>
	- It is okay to leave, swords to plowshares, and all that. 
<br>

<br>
	- Wow this feels like a kind of accepting death. Taking increasingly obscure roles, doing a nice little job, and just living my life. There's space for more for sure, and the jobs are only what I make of them so that's going to be great.
<br>

<br>
- 
<br>
- R birthday party today. 2hrs arcade then lunch then likely shifting focus towards school stuff.
<br>

<br>
- I feel I've built the bot enough. I get the ideas now and I'm a menace there. 
<br>

<br>
- cakes came together nicely
<br>

<br>
- [x] library cart assembly 
<br>

<br>
	- [x] 2nd cart??
<br>

<br>
- finished the bot. It works now. 
<br>

<br>
	- with and without client telemetry.
<br>

<br>
	- `cl_clearance` cookie lifespan may be low low. 
<br>

<br>
		- NOT present...
<br>

<br>
		- still working after several hours and changing a token expiry date to way further out...
<br>

<br>
	- still this thing vomits up its prompt...
<br>

<br>
	- [ ] find out what values need to be propagated. Minimal working data. 
<br>

<br>
	- at 1.5sec/message assuming token expires in 30min it's worth about $15. Wonder also multiple ips???
<br>

<br>
	- 
<br>
- playwright ideas
<br>

<br>
	- websocket snooping https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-websocketroute
<br>

<br>
	- go back to all websocket 
<br>

<br>
	- https://playwright.dev/docs/network abort collections. 
<br>

<br>
- [x] how to store fondant designs for transfer. 
<br>

<br>
- Got the bot into an incredible state. I learned so much! Now I can make web scrapers and do all kinds of mischief.
<br>

<br>
- get [https://pypi.org/project/semantic-text-splitter/](https://pypi.org/project/semantic-text-splitter/) into the pipeline somewhere.
<br>
- [x] switch obsidian to fs crawler and grep. 
<br>

<br>
	- [x] best effort: check if it's running. 
<br>

<br>
- [x] make Google MCP only for login and tokens. Do rest through API. But why?
<br>

<br>
- doing this tedious part has not been a waste. I'm learning a lot about management. 
<br>

<br>
- [x] crash course process mining?

<br>
- [s mining?
<br>

<br>
- Feeling stress. Worrying about:
<br>

<br>
	- Kids summer almost over
<br>

<br>
		- School supplies?
<br>

<br>
		- Lunches?
<br>

<br>
		- Workbooks?
<br>

<br>
	- Birthdays.
<br>

<br>
		- Got presents
<br>

<br>
		- Will help at the parties.
<br>

<br>
	- Shara
<br>

<br>
		- Lots of work and bad news lately. 
<br>

<br>
		- Clearly struggling with her mom.
<br>

<br>
		- Seems very tired.
<br>

<br>
	- Work
<br>

<br>
		- Am I okay trying to trust georg, and growing in this way? Am I okay pushing here? He seems willing to work with me.
<br>

<br>
		- Am I interested in copilot? Everything's always on fire.
<br>

<br>
	- Change.
<br>

<br>
		- Things are clearly changing. 
<br>

<br>
		- Upheaval alone is enough to unsettle the heart.
<br>

<br>
	- Death
<br>

<br>
		- Just... haunted recently.
<br>

<br>
		- Lots of thoughts about Grammy, Will. 
<br>

<br>
		- That's okay. I do miss them both.
<br>

<br>
		- I will go one day as well, but that's not my problem as soon as it happens.
<br>
- We want to cluster news articles intelligently. 
<br>

<br>
- What if we made an assumption about news carriers.
<br>

<br>
	- A carrier will not simultaneously run 2 stories on the same topic.
<br>

<br>
		- Therefore each story is its own topic
<br>

<br>
		- Therefore there are no inside-publisher clusters.
<br>

<br>
		- But you can cluster across the divide. Figure out which one is closest and if it is indeed close. The expectation should be 1-1-1 across clusters. It's easier to assume that they have the same biases and be proven wrong than the alternative.
<br>

<br>
		- [x] Modify the rss feed output to include source info.
<br>

<br>
		- [x] make a clusterer on this topic. (matmul only, max axis=0, i think.) (already used it once with axis=0. Unclear if it works or not)
<br>

<br>
		- [x] Make the whole document again, big style. Feed it to claude and get the summary it would make, then make whatever nonsense one on your own as necessary.
<br>

<br>
		- [x] italics it not `<it> blocks </it>` but `<i>italics</i>`
<br>

<br>
		- perhaps a better flow would have been to establish things with prompts then ask claude itself to translate them to code that does things in this way. 
<br>

<br>
- I want, yearn for things now. I want that job. I want to work on AI, I want to be a part of it all. I don't know why, precisely. I don't know what's an interview and what doesn't count. Maybe I am being and can be the person I want to be, who would push all those things with at least that much intention.
<br>

<br>
- Maybe I should give up and move to the west coast. Maybe I will move there in my 50s and lament that I would have found it fun all along. I will have wanted to. The man who imagines the city as a youth but only visits as an old man. desire is only a memory.
<br>

<br>
	- I need to read invisible cities again.
<br>

<br>
- THE BOT WORKS AGAIN! It just needed the copilot app user agent string `CopilotNative/1.25082.74.0-prod WindowsPicassoSdk/1.25082.74.0 (Windows 11 10.0.26100.0; .Net 9.0.3; X64)` 
<br>

<br>
	- Also hitting up the start and activate endpoints to appear more legitimate.
<br>

<br>
	- Still can't quite get the clarity version running but that user agent string is important.
<br>

<br>
- [ ] For next week, think about the following:
<br>

<br>
	- [ ] strategy doc re ltae? 
<br>

<br>
		- What would it contain? 
<br>

<br>
			- specifying the goal of the effort.
<br>

<br>
			- What have we tried in the past
<br>

<br>
			- what have we learned in the past.
<br>

<br>
			- What's different now? How the strategy is changing going forward
<br>

<br>
				- Tunings, etc.
<br>

<br>
			- How do we intend to measure?
<br>

<br>
			- Rough timeline.
<br>

<br>
		- Run by the team, esp RT, DB. Get ideas. 
<br>

<br>
		- Make sure everyone is on the same page.
<br>

<br>
		- something like a paper for the first study to justify the second, etc. 
<br>

<br>
		- Maybe WHALE, etc. 
<br>

<br>
	- [ ] If we want to make a team. How's the temperature for the team?
<br>

<br>
	- [ ] A 4th thought? What's my scope? Long term experiments. 
<br>

<br>
		- Then what? Coalesced Id??
<br>

<br>
- Finished Sebald's _The Rings of Saturn_. It wandered so aggressively and had so much beauty to show off. It animated the history of those dilapidated places. Beautiful. 
<br>

<br>
- 
<br>
- [x] water garden manual areas. 
<br>

<br>
- Bought L the Fuji instant camera. R the circuit mess communicator diy.

- [Cognitive Workspace: Active Memory Management for LLMs -- An Empirical Study of Functional Infinite Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13171)
	 - arXiv:2508.13171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and ...
- [Search-Time Data Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13180)
	 - arXiv:2508.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or...
- [QuickMerge++: Fast Token Merging with Autoregressive Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13204)
	 - arXiv:2508.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck. While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static, modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed fo...
- [SPANER: Shared Prompt Aligner for Multimodal Semantic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13387)
	 - arXiv:2508.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result, modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER),...
- [Breaking the SFT Plateau: Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning for Chart-to-Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13587)
	 - arXiv:2508.13587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient, highligh...
- [Revisiting RAG Ensemble: A Theoretical and Mechanistic Analysis of Multi-RAG System Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13828)
	 - arXiv:2508.13828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on ...
- [Contextual Attention-Based Multimodal Fusion of LLM and CNN for Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13196)
	 - arXiv:2508.13196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management. Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately, our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing, lever...
- [Hierarchical Conformal Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13288)
	 - arXiv:2508.13288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledg...
- [Decoding Communications with Partial Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13326)
	 - arXiv:2508.13326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby po...
- [X-MoE: Enabling Scalable Training for Emerging Mixture-of-Experts Architectures on HPC Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13337)
	 - arXiv:2508.13337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication. Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs - perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant c...
- [Dimension lower bounds for linear approaches to function approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13346)
	 - arXiv:2508.13346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note presents a linear algebraic approach to proving dimension lower bounds for linear methods that solve $L^2$ function approximation problems. The basic argument has appeared in the literature before (e.g., Barron, 1993) for establishing lower bounds on Kolmogorov $n$-widths. The argument is applied to give sample size lower bounds for kernel methods.
- [Adaptive Conformal Prediction Intervals Over Trajectory Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13362)
	 - arXiv:2508.13362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectori...
- [Decentralized Contextual Bandits with Network Adaptivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13411)
	 - arXiv:2508.13411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored in networked environments when information is partially share...
- [MAVIS: Multi-Objective Alignment via Value-Guided Inference-Time Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13415)
	 - arXiv:2508.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives -- such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alig...
- [SVDformer: Direction-Aware Spectral Graph Embedding Learning via SVD and Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13435)
	 - arXiv:2508.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-awar...
- [Bounding Causal Effects and Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13607)
	 - arXiv:2508.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice. Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied wo...
- [Text2Weight: Bridging Natural Language and Neural Network Weight Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13633)
	 - arXiv:2508.13633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integr...
- [Explainable Learning Rate Regimes for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13639)
	 - arXiv:2508.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD), whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated aut...
- [GRAFT: Gradient-Aware Fast MaxVol Technique for Dynamic Data Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13653)
	 - arXiv:2508.13653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-...
- [MACTAS: Self-Attention-Based Module for Inter-Agent Communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13661)
	 - arXiv:2508.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, a...
- [DREAMS: Preserving both Local and Global Structure in Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13747)
	 - arXiv:2508.13747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS, PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure pr...
- [Fisher-Orthogonal Projection Methods for Natural Gradient Descent with Large Batches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13898)
	 - arXiv:2508.13898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory, enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global minimum. ...
- [Convergent Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Stochastic Shortest Path Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13963)
	 - arXiv:2508.13963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose two algorithms in the tabular setting and an algorithm for the function approximation setting for the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem. SSP problems form an important class of problems in Reinforcement Learning (RL), as other types of cost-criteria in RL can be formulated in the setting of SSP. We show asymptotic almost-sure convergence for all our algorithms. We observe superior performance of our tabular algorithms...
- [AutoScale: Linear Scalarization Guided by Multi-Task Optimization Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13979)
	 - arXiv:2508.13979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO ...
- [Learning from Preferences and Mixed Demonstrations in General Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14027)
	 - arXiv:2508.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale. We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational...
- [Preference Models assume Proportional Hazards of Utilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13189)
	 - arXiv:2508.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approaches for estimating preferences from human annotated data typically involves inducing a distribution over a ranked list of choices such as the Plackett-Luce model. Indeed, modern AI alignment tools such as Reward Modelling and Direct Preference Optimization are based on the statistical assumptions posed by the Plackett-Luce model. In this paper, I will connect the Plackett-Luce model to another classical and well known statistical model, the...
- [Online Conformal Selection with Accept-to-Reject Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13838)
	 - arXiv:2508.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting a subset of promising candidates from a large pool is crucial across various scientific and real-world applications. Conformal selection offers a distribution-free and model-agnostic framework for candidate selection with uncertainty quantification. While effective in offline settings, its application to online scenarios, where data arrives sequentially, poses challenges. Notably, conformal selection permits the deselection of previously...
- [Generalisation and benign over-fitting for linear regression onto random functional covariates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13895)
	 - arXiv:2508.13895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretical predictive performance of ridge and ridge-less least-squares regression when covariate vectors arise from evaluating $p$ random, means-square continuous functions over a latent metric space at $n$ random and unobserved locations, subject to additive noise. This leads us away from the standard assumption of i.i.d. data to a setting in which the $n$ covariate vectors are exchangeable but not independent in general. Under an assu...

- [Beyond Good and Evil](https://www.metafilter.com/211163/Beyond-Good-and-Evil) (https://rss.metafilter.com/metafilter.rss)
  Mysteries of Love, Horror and Art. A long and thoughtful essay on the enigma of Alice Munro, a short story genius who won the Nobel Prize for Literature but who also covered up the abuse of her daughter by her husband, Gerald Fremlin. It discusses how her behavior is reflected, covered up and justified in the art of her stories:
"Alice Munro's daughters have also passed into art thanks to her acts of unsparing,
unsentimental love. Acts done out of love, Nietzsche once said, stand beyond good and
evil. If this is what art amounts to, we should be grateful to Alice Munro for reminding us
to be properly frightened of it." "If Fremlin's behavior was normal at least from the perspective of criminal psychopathology, Munro's is harder to fathom. Her decision to allow herself to become practically
and emotionally dependent on an eccentric pedophile was strange enough even before he
abused her daughter. No doubt she sincerely loved him, but surely a large part of why she
remained in this bizarre domestic situation was because it created the conditions that she
needed in order to write, to produce the art that was (as she told an interviewer) "the final thing" in her life. To use Bea Doud's language from "Vandals," Munro's was a greater or
at least a far stranger insanity than Fremlin's, and her family lived inside of it."

-----

"If Munro thought, as she told Barbara Frum, that "the springs of creativity and sex are
all together," and her understanding of sexuality is so tightly connected to domination and
even to brutality, is her fiction, then, a celebration of the cruelty of the erotic? This would
not be quite correct, because she also makes space in it for that other aspect of "the dark
side of human nature," "the impulses that make us religious." Munro believes that to be
human is necessarily to seek to make sense of the seemingly incomprehensible brutality of
nature, including the brutality of our erotic natures. This need to tame by explanation is
for her the shared origin of both religion and poetry, perhaps even of language."

This is normally a peaceful, aromatic ceremony, performed at many saunas across Europe and a few in Canada. During "classic Aufguss," sauna masters first create scented steam by putting snowballs impregnated with essential oils—eucalyptus, mandarin, lavender—on the sauna oven's rocks. Then, accompanied by relaxing music, they wave towels in elegant motions to distribute the scented air around the hot room. from The Steamy, Sweaty, Towel-Spinning Weirdness of the World Sauna Championships [The Walrus]

- [_em_The Atlantic_/em_’s January Cover: Michael Scherer Profiles Robert F. Kennedy Jr., ‘The Most Powerful Man in Science’](https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/2025/11/atlantics-january-cover-michael-scherer-on-rfk-jr/685023/?utm_source=feed) (https://www.theatlantic.com/feed/all/)
  For The Atlantic ’s January cover story, “ The Most Powerful Man in Science ,” staff writer Michael Scherer profiles Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of health and human services, as he crusades against what he perceives as the corruption of the scientific establishment. Scherer asks what it means when the country can’t agree on common facts—even those once considered validated by the scientific method––and examines why RFK Jr. is so convinced that he’s right in his beliefs. “The whole medical establishment has huge stakes and equities that I’m now threatening,” Kennedy told The Atlantic . “And I’m shocked President Trump lets me do it.” Scherer had extensive access to Kennedy and his top deputies at HHS for the profile, including Jay Bhattacharya, Marty Makary, and Mehmet Oz––all of whom were bonded by the experience of COVID “in a fellowship of the ostracized.” Since Trump put him in charge of HHS, Kennedy has, in conjunction with the White House, pushed out about one in four HHS employees, including much of the senior career staff and thousands of workers at the CDC, which Kennedy described to Scherer as a “snake pit.” (Kennedy compares his relationship with Trump to “when you’re dating somebody that you keep liking more and more.”) And though Kennedy has slashed the budget of his own department, he now tells Scherer that he plans to spend billions of dollars investigating vaccines’ potential ties to chronic diseases. Discussing COVID-vaccine boosters, Kennedy tells Scherer: “You never do an intervention—particularly with a healthy human being—unless you know that it’s safe and effective. And we don’t know if it’s safe and effective.” Throughout their interviews, Scherer writes, he often found himself jousting with Kennedy about the details of one scientific debate or another. Scherer writes that Kennedy says he’s open to listening to other viewpoints, but, “when presented with data that contradict his arguments, Kennedy regularly claims bad faith on the part of his adversaries—­that they’re motivated by profit or professional advancement. His experience as a litigator may have made this reflexive. As John Morgan, his litigation partner, told me, it’s hard to sue polluters and cigarette companies and not come away convinced that the defendants are ‘in the business of premeditated murder.’ Kennedy has applied the same lens to the medical establishment, casting it as powered by the big pharmaceutical companies and their government protectors—despite the fact that most pediatricians and virologists and epidemiologists have devoted their lives to helping children and reducing suffering.” Additional highlights from Scherer’s article: On physical threats: On the flight where Kennedy learned that Charlie Kirk had been shot, he told Scherer that “his security team recently circulated a memo warning him of threats to his own life. ‘It said the resentments against me had elevated “above the threshold of lethality,” ’ he said. Kennedy greeted the threat assessment with remarkable equanimity for someone with his family’s history.” Kennedy said he told Trump not to post a warning on social media about pregnant women taking Tylenol: “‘You can’t do that,’ Kennedy said he told the president. ‘There’s nuance to it, and you can’t scare people away from Tylenol, and you’re going to get a huge amount of pushback from powerful pharmaceutical companies.’ Trump’s reply: ‘I don’t give a shit about that.’” On Kennedy’s life as an addict in recovery, and his current nicotine and tanning habits: “Although Kennedy says he has not taken heroin since he got clean, he still considers his brain to be a sort of ‘formulation pharmacy,’ able to transform anything—rock climbing, falconry, sex—into a drug.” “I asked him how much being an addict in recovery still affects him. ‘I think it’s shaped everything,’ he said. Even as HHS secretary, he sponsors others in recovery. ‘I take calls all the time.’” “When I asked him to square his nicotine habit and the time he spends tanning with the federal health advisories against both, he shifted in his chair. ‘I’m not telling people that they should do anything that I do,’ he said. ‘I just say “Get in shape.”’ ” On Kennedy’s claims that experts are unwilling to debate him: “Even now that he sits atop America’s health bureaucracy, Kennedy told me, public-health authorities—­whose convictions, he said, are more akin to religion than science—­will not engage with him. … ‘You’re the HHS secretary,’ I said. ‘Presumably you can call anybody at CDC to have this debate.’ ‘There’s 21,000 people in that agency, and I’m not going to have a personal debate with each one of them,’ he responded. ‘By the way, they’re leaving because they can’t defend their position.’” Kennedy on “trusting the experts” as a “feature of totalitarianism and religion”: “‘Trusting the experts’ is not a feature of science,’ he likes to say. ‘It’s not a feature of democracy. It’s a feature of totalitarianism and religion.’ But having everyone ‘do their own research,’ as Kennedy recommends, was untenable even before the advent of technologies like nanoscience and genomic editing. When I suggested to Kennedy that he was now presuming to play the role of health expert himself, he rejected that. ‘I don’t tell people to trust me. I tell people, “Don’t trust me.”’” Senator Bill Cassidy, a gastro­enterologist who cast the deciding vote to confirm Kennedy as HHS secretary, said that “he and the HHS secretary regularly share scientific articles and papers with each other. ‘I find that he often will send me the same article more than once,’ Cassidy told me. Yet whenever Cassidy points out ‘statistical flaws’ in the article, he said, Kennedy says he considers those ‘immaterial.’” Kennedy on the media, and on this profile: “He suggested that he regretted agreeing to talk with me, and compared our relationship to the fable of the scorpion who asks the frog for help crossing a river, only to sting and kill the frog after it does. ‘Every article about me is the same, which is never science-based; it’s never an argument; it’s always an ad hominem attack,’ he continued. ‘“He’s a conspiracy theorist, he’s anti-science, he’s a crazy person, he’s got a brain worm,” or the bear story, or the whale story, or the dog story, any of these, and that’s what they focus on.’ Articles about some of these colorful episodes from his past, he believed, were efforts to distract from the substance of his arguments. ‘I challenge you to tell me one conspiracy that I’ve talked about that has not come true,’ he said.” Michael Scherer’s “ The Most Powerful Man in Science ” was published today at TheAtlantic.com.

  But those parties, and that bohemian lifestyle, were just one aspect of Matthiessen's life. He would take the metro to meet his CIA handler in the Jeu de Paume, and they would stroll from the museum to the gardens near the Louvre and discuss his assignments. What he was actually working on for the CIA is still opaque. Matthiessen described it later as "deceiving people" and "serial lying." Until the CIA releases its files, it's always going to be a bit shadowy. I assume he was spying on other expat Americans, his friends.

  This weekend, Lee Tamahori won Best Director Drama Feature for The Convert at the 2025 NZ Screen Awards. Unfortunately he passed away earlier this month after a battle with Parkinsons. This capped off a long career of filmmaking, stretching back to the late 1970s working as a Boom Operator, stepping up to 1st Assistant Director in the 80s, before directing his first feature film Once Were Warriors in 1994.

Tamahori also founded ad agency Flying Fish, making memorable ads like Bungy Fishing , Safety Belts , and Great Team .

After the success of Once Were Warriors, he moved to Hollywood where he  made a name for himself with blockbusters like Along Came A Spider , xXx State Of The Union , and Die Another Day .

  From fake honey to fake oregano: The mission to fight food fraud. As consumers, it's almost impossible to tell if a label on food is genuine. A small team of scientists are taking on this big problem. In 2013 DNA testing found horse meat in beef lasagnes in the United Kingdom, sparking an investigation that linked the scandal to organised crime.

In Australia consumer advocacy group Choice found seven out of 12 oregano products contained ingredients other than the herb — like olive leaves — in 2016.

A study by Macquarie University in 2018 found one in five samples of Australian honey were adulterated — meaning the honey had been mixed with non-honey substances.

The study said honey is the world's third-most adulterated food source, after milk and olive oil.

Almost 12 per cent of seafood items are mislabelled in Australia, according to a 2023 study commissioned by Andrew and Nicola Forrest's Minderoo Foundation. In that same year, the ACCC fined Costco $33,000 for labelling Canadian lobster as Australian.

  Whilst quite diverse and very much in leagues of their own, all these writers resurrect high-modernist procedures (streamed interiority, montage/collage, documentary apparatus, polyphony) and put those "dead" forms to work inside today's mediascape, often with literal ghosts, archives, or revenant voices. What unites their necromodernist impulses is not style or ideology but a shared condition: writing in a time when literature is no longer central even to itself and finding in that marginality a strange freedom. from Necromodernist Architectures in Contemporary Writing

  The Amazing Journey of Dalia Verbickas Ancevicius From Lithuanian Refugee Camp in Germany to Designing Iconic American Toys to, Now, a Museum Show at the Age of Eighty-Six Found in the comments of a post about the Lite Brite, please enjoy this: "There were no toys when Dalia Verbickas Ancevicius lived with her family between 1944 and 1949 in a Lithuanian refugee camp in Hanau, Germany. Ancevicius was eleven when her family left Germany for America's open doors. To pass time in the camp she played a homemade game with friends to see who would be the first to slap hands down.

Ancevicius' inspiring story of immigration led her to become an industrial designer at the iconic Marvin Glass & Associates toy design company in Chicago. Ancevicius was the firm's first and only female designer in the "Mad Men" era.

And in 1964 she brought the popular board game "Hands Down" to the table." More: "Many times Ancevicius wasn't given full props for her design ideas. "I didn't want to take credit for Lite-Brite but I initiated that," she says. "They called me in at two in the morning. I came in from a friend's wedding in Rockford for a meeting. Somebody had to fly out the next day. So I was working and said, 'I have an idea guys.' I came up with the color strips." She designed the idea of using a translucent material to direct colored light. Ancevicius reasoned that tubes were like fibers. If one end was lit the light could travel to the other end. A professor once told her if she doesn't have a source of light in her paintings it does not have life. She knew it would be a great idea for a toy. Joseph Burck of Marvin Glass designed the toy. Lite-Brite was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2022."

But these democracy ambassadors are working hard to ensure everyone knows their rights. (Australia) From the Australian Electoral Commission website:

"Can prisoners vote in by-elections, federal elections, and referendums?

Yes. If a prisoner is serving a full-time sentence of less than three years, it is compulsory to vote in a by-election, federal election and referendum. Prisoners serving a sentence of three years or longer cannot vote until after they have been released from prison."

  What Did Men Do to Deserve This? [ ungated ] - "Changes in the economy and in the culture seem to have hit them hard. Scott Galloway believes they need an 'aspirational vision of masculinity.'" America's young men are in crisis. "Seldom in recent memory has there been a cohort that's fallen farther, faster," he writes in his new book, "Notes on Being a Man." ... And these under-thirties, Kirk said, were receiving a pernicious message: "You're not going to have the same American Dream that your parents would have." He and his fellow conservative organizers "saw this as an opportunity," he added, "especially with young men." Donald Trump won men under age thirty by fifty-six per cent in the 2024 election, up fifteen points from 2020. For these gains, Kirk credited the coalescing electoral power of the right-leaning constellation of podcasters and streamers known as the manosphere, which encompasses libertarian bros, evangelical Christians, and white nationalists.

[...]

What some Democrats would prefer, it seems, is a centrist manosphere of their own. (One imagines a podcast studio attached to a well-appointed gym where a bunch of white guys are discussing "Abundance" over beta-alanine smoothies and doing pistol squats to the theme song from "Pod Save America.") In "Notes on Being a Man," Galloway—who has expressed bullishness on the Presidential prospects of both Newsom and Emanuel—declares that discontented members of Gen Z and the boys and teens of Gen Alpha need an "aspirational vision of masculinity," a vision opposed to the misogynist messaging that's epitomized by influencers such as Andrew Tate and Nick Fuentes. Part self-help memoir and part Dudes Rock polemic, the book presents a capital-letter credo: "Men Protect, Provide, and Procreate." Masculinity can be expressed simply by "getting up at fucking six in the morning and going to work and doing shitty work such that you can protect your family economically," Galloway once said. And the evolved man also insures that he does not slack off "domestically, emotionally, or logistically," leaving his partner to ask, in Galloway's signature demotic, "O.K., boss, what the fuck are you bringing to the table?"

The good man of the reasonable center, in Galloway's view, adheres to a code indistinguishable from that of the Boy Scouts: mental and physical fitness, emotional resilience, hard work, financial prudence, caring for others. Few could object to any of this. But the person it describes—a kind and conscientious sort, who aspires to make a decent living and who looks after their loved ones—seems blessedly gender-free. So why make this about manhood? Even the Boy Scouts have gone coed.

[...]

The ambassadors of the centrist manosphere praise women's advancement and the feminist cause while insisting that men's economic and vocational anxieties are more naturally potent. This ambivalence reveals the weakness of their side. The right-wing manosphere knows that masculinity is a series of dominance signals beamed from behind iridescent Oakleys and the wheel of the most enormous pickup truck you've ever seen; it is a smirking multimillionaire who "DESTROYS" a young woman at a college-hosted debate; it is—must it be said?—an AR-15, openly carried. Manliness in the Trump era, Susan Faludi has written, "is defined by display value," which exhibits itself in a "pantomime of aggrieved aggression." Upon this stage, men's biggest problem is feminism, and the solutions are straightforward: restrict reproductive rights, propagandize about traditional gender roles, etc.

The squishier centrist side has no such certainties. Galloway, in both his podcasts and "Notes on Being a Man," presents masculinity not as one side of a fixed binary but as a state of mind and a life style, one equally available to men and women, and therefore impossible to define. (It's a feeling, and we know how Trump supporters feel about those.) Within this amorphous framework, men's biggest problem is, likewise, a feeling—an unreachable itch, or a marrow-deep belief—that men should still rank above women in the social hierarchy, just not as much as before. This belief may be misguided or unconscious, but it is nonetheless insuperable, and it must be accommodated, for the good of us all.

What these pundits are nudging us to do, ever so politely, is accept that women, in the main, are accustomed to being a little degraded , a little underpaid and ignored and dampened in their ambitions, in ways that men are not and never will be. also btw... They're more likely to suffer addiction, slip into sadness, land in jail, stay jobless, remain single, isolate — even kill themselves — than previous generations of men. Man up - " Surplus value means making the transition to giving more back, without keeping score. For men, this means providing more love to others than was given to you — becoming a better son, brother, friend, or employer. As a father, your job is to create surplus value as measured by being a better dad than your dad was to you." Protect: "In Yiddish, the word mensch translates to 'a just, honest, or honorable person," Galloway writes. "It's a good shorthand phrase for healthy masculinity in 2025. The first instinct of a mensch is to protect, to sacrifice for something bigger than oneself, and not to pick on the vulnerable but to look out for your family and community." "Real men don't start bar fights; they break them up. They don't shit-post other people or their country; they defend both. A man's default setting should be to protect, in any situation. If he conflates being male with coarseness, savagery, bullying, predation, abuse of power, etc., he's not masculine — he's anti-masculine." Provide: "Historically, being a provider was a man's job," Galloway continues. "But women also becoming breadwinners doesn't mean the role is any less important for men. At the outset of his career, every man should assume he needs to take economic responsibility for his household. A man with a decent job in a strong economy is creating wealth, paying taxes, and earning social capital, not to mention his own self-respect. He also provides stability, support, love, and trust for his family, community, and himself." "Being a provider sometimes means getting out of the way of a wife or partner who may be better at the money thing, and picking up the slack elsewhere without being weird about it." Procreate: "The third leg of masculinity is ensuring the species survives," Galloway adds. "This doesn't mean having children is an obligation — lots of people can't or choose not to, and are instead great uncles, aunts, cousins, friends, and mentors — but arguably it's why we're here." "A good [parent] invests time, energy, and resources to raise kids who are stronger, smarter, faster, more impressive — better, basically — than he is," Galloway concludes. 6 roles for the modern man - "It's easy for algorithms to normalize or aggrandize saying, doing, acting as you want, consequences be damned. It's easy to slip into video games or porn or conspiracies or loneliness. It's easy to lose sight of what makes great people actually great ." Live honorably. All great people sacrifice greatly, often silently, in pursuit of what's right and good. They do hard things — and the right things — because that's what good people do. This demands courage, honesty and love of things beyond self. You can do this at school, by being a trusted classmate and diligent student; while dating, by being respectful; at work, by leading with the example of your effort; and in changing things broadly, by picking worthy fights and fighting them courageously and admirably. It's better to accomplish little, but live righteously, than to achieve success or riches unrighteously. Love greatly. Most men probably scoff at those two words. They're too "tough" for sappiness. But you only feel fully human, fully alive, fully purposeful with deep, real, emotional relationships. Most men suck at this — especially with other men. Real relationships are hard — they demand work, embarrassment, frustration and emotional intelligence. But it's worth the effort. Relationships ground us, inspire us and instruct us. Every young man needs a male mentor, and every good adult male needs to step up and be one. The one common conclusion of almost all studies on longevity and happiness is the importance of strong, close relationships. Think deeply. You don't need to be a nerd or a bookworm to be a good man in full. But you do need to study — study your strengths and weaknesses, study other men of high character to emulate, study your friends and enemies to better understand human nature, study the world around you to find how to best thrive and help. Be gritty, not greedy. The trick to life is not getting more — it's getting through more. Perseverance is toughness. Grit is toughness. It's the trainable muscle to push through when life feels impossible, to surmount, not succumb. I once believed you were mostly born with grit. But I watched our adopted son, after losing both parents, transform from being a lackadaisical teenager to a man of tremendous grit — and honor. He was pushed and applauded by other good men. That's manly. Work and serve strenuously. Every man has a moral obligation to work hard and serve others, starting with their families. Men, in particular, know they're prone to waste time doing bad or perverted things when they're not working at a job or on a cause. The rigor of work and service provides direction — and worthy satisfaction. If everyone works hard, particularly in historic moments like these, America soars. Be a worthy dad/husband. We stopped glorifying simply being a good husband and then a good father. It's a tradition as old as time. Nothing in life provides more satisfaction and meaning. Men need to do their part by being attractive partners — which means holding a job, treating others well, and showing the ability to love and serve others.

  Inside YouTube: A Writer's View on 500 Million+ Views, Platform Mechanics & Creative Trade-offs Justin Kuiper has spent over a decade as a YouTube writer and creative director, working for MatPat's Theorist channels (Game Theorists, Film Theorists, Style Theorists, and Food Theorists). His videos have amassed over half a billion views.  This interview reads more like a long-form essay than a breezy talk-to-an-expert piece. One surprising takeaway is how Youtube is a promising platform for writers. "I think there's two separate approaches to video-creation. One is more the "artist's" approach, where you make the video that you want to make, and then you try to come up with a hook for it and a title or thumbnail for it. The question of, "How do I get people to watch the thing I made" is almost an afterthought. You're David Lynch, you're Werner Herzog. That's what an artist does.

The opposite of the artist's approach is the "content creator's approach." You start by thinking, "What does my audience want to see?" And then you make that video. In some cases you start with the title and thumbnail before you've even made the video. And, not surprisingly, these videos tend to do better.

And by the way, this is how a lot of media is made including IP-driven blockbusters. You have studios that start by deciding, "Okay, we have the rights to make a Spider-Man movie, we're going to make a Spider-Man movie", and then they find a screenwriter and a director and actors. Maybe they have posters and marketing before the movie is even done filming.

I think describing these sorts of videos as "marketing first" is accurate. The creator is concerned with clickability, or in the case of the blockbuster, they're thinking about whether they have an IP that will get people to buy movie tickets. I think it can have a bad connotation, because people think of marketing as gross, and it feels crass and commercial.

But if you view it in a different light, in a sense, the content creator has to have more empathy for their audience than the artist does. In a way, it's more humble. Like, I'm not so smart that I should assume that everyone else is interested in the same things I'm interested in. I should listen to my audience and let them tell me what they want to see. And okay, it looks like my audience likes this type of video, okay, I'll make that. It's possible for this to go too far. Again, you see this in Hollywood. "

"I will say that it's really hard to hire good writers. I realize that's kind of self-serving, because I'm a writer, but everyone I talk to feels this way, and it was true for me when I was trying to hire more writers as a creative director. Sam Denby from Wendover Productions has talked about how it's just really hard to hire good YouTube writers, and from what I understand he goes for journalism school grads and trains them to write YouTube scripts. The market for writers is higher-friction than for editors or thumbnail designers, there is much more of a process of learning the "voice" of the channel.

I think a big part of the challenge of trying to hire a "YouTube scriptwriter" is that writing across verticals isn't super fungible. You have some YouTube scriptwriters who are basically copywriters for verticals where you're aiming for something close to "LinkedIn-speak", and then you have educational verticals where you have writers who are spending a week reading academic research papers and books and summarizing what they've learned, and then people who are doing deep-dives on hobby stuff, or celebrity drama. All of those are kind of different skillsets."

"And by the way, there's this open question on YouTube of how to credit people in video descriptions. Because if someone credits their editor in the video description, then you can get in touch with that person and hire them. If they don't want you poaching their editor, maybe they don't credit them. And if you're that editor who is not getting a video credit for that reason, my advice to you would be to charge your client a premium for that. You don't even have to give up the right to feature that work in your portfolio.

Back when I was doing work for B2B SaaS clients my rate was something like:

You can pay $X and credit me and put my social media link in the description
You can pay me 1.5 * $X and not credit me in the description but I'll feature you in my portfolio
You can pay me 2 * $X and this will be 100% ghostwritten.
And basically all of them opted for the more expensive rates."

"...if you ask kids what they want to be when they grow up, a lot of them will say "teacher" because that's the adult profession that they interact with the most often.

Kids say they want to be an athlete, doctor, vet, firefighter, or a YouTuber because those are legible professions. Their teacher says, "you have a talent for soccer" and they think, "Oh, I'm good at soccer, maybe I'll become a pro athlete like my hero, Messi." Nobody's kid is saying "I want to be an actuary" or "I want to be an auditor." And, you know, the number of kids who can actually grow up to have a job related to YouTube is actually way higher than the number who can grow up to be a veterinarian. Not everyone can be a "famous YouTuber", but you can make a good living as a video editor."

  Anime as a medium has made prominent use of on-screen text basically since its inception. The amount of it varies from series to series, but almost every anime out there makes use of on-screen text at one point or another, with some featuring downright ridiculous amounts of signs (what on-screen text is called for short). With all this on-screen text, it is very common for there to be text visible on the screen potentially in multiple positions, even when characters are speaking. As such, if you are in the business of localizing anime for non-Japanese audiences, you need to be able to deal with on-screen text. from Crunchyroll is destroying its subtitles for no good reason

  First Hike Project helps refugees experience hiking in Australia's bushland for the first time. A community-led hiking program is introducing refugees to the bush, offering moments of connection, discovery and, for some, a sense of safety. (Australia) " First Hike Project is a Not-For-Profit organisation operating out of Perth, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra .

First Hike Project takes youth from refugee background on all-expenses-paid and all-equipment-provided overnight hiking and camping experience in the Australian bush. Our goal is to offer safe, no-cost hiking experiences to people new to our country, with the hope they will feel more at home in Australia once they step outside the suburbs and discover nature.

All gear, food, drinks and transport is supplied so there is no cost to the participant whatsoever. All food is culturally sensitive, and time is set aside for cultural and religious practices if need be. Day hikes are also run which can be good for including family members who are not in the youth demographic we normally target."

## AI Model & Hardware Developments

[Ilya Sutskever declares](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/ilya-sutskever-2) that AI is transitioning "from the age of scaling to the age of research," signaling a potential shift in development paradigms.

  Rare goanna missing again from Canberra reserve. One of a handful of Rosenberg's goannas living in the ACT's hill reserves has once again wandered off, prompting calls from a local conservation organisation for help bringing him back . The National Parks Association of the ACT (NPA ACT) said Rum was one of just six or seven Rosenberg's goannas living in the area, and described him as a "repeat offender" who "ignores all advice" not to explore the suburbs near his home.

NPA ACT Ecologist Don Fletcher said the first time Rum went missing from the nature reserve where he lives, he was found in a backyard on Limestone Avenue.

"He actually moved along the street from backyard to backyard ... one of which he actually went up to the window [and tapped on it]," Dr Fletcher said.

"Eventually he went on to other houses. I got a phone call and went there, captured him, and took him back up to Mount Ainslie.

"So that was 2024 — and now he turns up in the suburbs, the idiot thing. I wish he'd take the advice and stay in the reserve."

Dr Fletcher said goannas were remarkably intelligent, capable of recognising and remembering individual people, and having a memory that lasts for years.

 "Goannas are known to be able to count to six ... which is very rare indeed in the animal kingdom," he said.

- ["non-ideal Kant"](https://www.metafilter.com/211238/non-ideal-Kant) (https://rss.metafilter.com/metafilter.rss)
  Immanuel Kant — Chief Architect of Scientific Racism is a short blogpost by Nathan Allen [ archive ] laying out Immanuel Kant's theories of race . It builds on the 2005 essay Kant's Untermenschen by Charles W. Mills, which itself was a response to Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze's The Color of Reason and Robert Bernasconi's critiques of Kant . This caused a stir among Kant scholars, with many responses. The best I've encountered is Nathan Bauer's 2016 lecture Dealing with Kant's Racism , which seeks to separate the racism from the moral philosophy. But the issue kept being raised, e.g. by Jamelle Bouie regarding Enlightenment and Victor Fabian Abundez-Guerra on how to teach Kant . The most thorough examination is probably Huaping Lu-Adler's Kant, Race, and Racism: Views from Somewhere , which was the subject of a symposium at the Digitales Kant-Zentrum . Lu-Adler also explained her approach, and how it's impossible to neatly separate aspects of Kant's thinking, in a podcast interview with Haley Brennan .

See you this Tuesday Dec. 2 at 7:00pm @ 350 Kimbark St. (Speaking sign-up is at 6:30pm.) Want to see where the cameras are?
