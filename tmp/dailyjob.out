Previous theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of e...', 0.0], ['- [Topos Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08295)\n\t - arXiv:2508.08295v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, whi...', 1.0], ['- [An Efficient Application of Goal Programming to Tackle Multiobjective Problems with Recurring Fitness Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08297)\n\t - arXiv:2508.08297v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms.

# Recent Journal Entries

<br>

<br>
	- That needs to be a thing.
<br>

<br>
	- Questions today?
<br>

<br>
		- need to ask about how many ppl in org. 3 units, 10k total, 2k smallest.
<br>

<br>
		- what is the cultural issue? it's faster than ms people like typicaly.
<br>

<br>
		- what will the job likely consist of? A little more hectic, a little more myo impact. 
<br>

<br>
		- When do the meetings start and end? same as now.
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
-  The bot works! I needed to state-save from a different browser and then it was beautiful. Worked for several hours before I got tagged. I think this is how it's actually done. Hoping to step out of this workstream now. 
<br>

<br>
- it's... jittery. It's all jittery. That's fine too.
<br>

<br>
- the 0.6 b predictions were unstable? some trues and falses. Lots of instances. Like it doesn't understand. 
<br>

<br>
	- Just doing them with claude instead. Why not?
<br>

<br>
	- Can do this -> training data.
<br>

<br>
	- started today at maybe 1-2?
<br>

<br>
- Drawers bug me but they're so useful. I love the design and wind up foot-gunning with it all too frequently.
<br>

<br>
- Ben A meeting:
<br>

<br>
	- turned off 2nd monitor. Interesting for a test, at least.
<br>

<br>
	- He's a few late. 
<br>

<br>
	- good talk. Very candid. Very clear that he's not with ExP anymore.
<br>

<br>
- Yeah, hearing JR talk, it's clear to me that LTAE is doomed. There's a revenue crunch, and a drive to increase ad load. He feels defeated. There's no shame in being a rat, and leaving the ship as soon as it starts to sink.
<br>

<br>
	- I don't have to be proud of it. It's okay to not be.
<br>

<br>
- Need to embrace the ipad more, but without the controller.
<br>

<br>
- I see what it is. I see an aspect of it. I was able to experiment, experiments were king, but waning. I got to run one of the biggest A/B shops in the world. But, they're not going to be valuable anymore, because political power is being reconsolidated away. 
<br>

<br>
	- I will go then, away from experimentation, and do analytics and forecasting. 
<br>

<br>
	- It is okay to leave, swords to plowshares, and all that. 
<br>

<br>
	- Wow this feels like a kind of accepting death. Taking increasingly obscure roles, doing a nice little job, and just living my life. There's space for more for sure, and the jobs are only what I make of them so that's going to be great.
<br>

<br>
- 
<br>
- R birthday party today. 2hrs arcade then lunch then likely shifting focus towards school stuff.
<br>

<br>
- I feel I've built the bot enough. I get the ideas now and I'm a menace there. 
<br>

<br>
- cakes came together nicely
<br>

<br>
- [x] library cart assembly 
<br>

<br>
	- [x] 2nd cart??
<br>

<br>
- finished the bot. It works now. 
<br>

<br>
	- with and without client telemetry.
<br>

<br>
	- `cl_clearance` cookie lifespan may be low low. 
<br>

<br>
		- NOT present...
<br>

<br>
		- still working after several hours and changing a token expiry date to way further out...
<br>

<br>
	- still this thing vomits up its prompt...
<br>

<br>
	- [ ] find out what values need to be propagated. Minimal working data. 
<br>

<br>
	- at 1.5sec/message assuming token expires in 30min it's worth about $15. Wonder also multiple ips???
<br>

<br>
	- 
<br>
- playwright ideas
<br>

<br>
	- websocket snooping https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-websocketroute
<br>

<br>
	- go back to all websocket 
<br>

<br>
	- https://playwright.dev/docs/network abort collections. 
<br>

<br>
- [x] how to store fondant designs for transfer. 
<br>

<br>
- Got the bot into an incredible state. I learned so much! Now I can make web scrapers and do all kinds of mischief.
<br>

<br>
- get [https://pypi.org/project/semantic-text-splitter/](https://pypi.org/project/semantic-text-splitter/) into the pipeline somewhere.
<br>
- [x] switch obsidian to fs crawler and grep. 
<br>

<br>
	- [x] best effort: check if it's running. 
<br>

<br>
- [x] make Google MCP only for login and tokens. Do rest through API. But why?
<br>

<br>
- doing this tedious part has not been a waste. I'm learning a lot about management. 
<br>

<br>
- [x] crash course process mining?

<br>
- [s mining?
<br>

<br>
- Feeling stress. Worrying about:
<br>

<br>
	- Kids summer almost over
<br>

<br>
		- School supplies?
<br>

<br>
		- Lunches?
<br>

<br>
		- Workbooks?
<br>

<br>
	- Birthdays.
<br>

<br>
		- Got presents
<br>

<br>
		- Will help at the parties.
<br>

<br>
	- Shara
<br>

<br>
		- Lots of work and bad news lately. 
<br>

<br>
		- Clearly struggling with her mom.
<br>

<br>
		- Seems very tired.
<br>

<br>
	- Work
<br>

<br>
		- Am I okay trying to trust georg, and growing in this way? Am I okay pushing here? He seems willing to work with me.
<br>

<br>
		- Am I interested in copilot? Everything's always on fire.
<br>

<br>
	- Change.
<br>

<br>
		- Things are clearly changing. 
<br>

<br>
		- Upheaval alone is enough to unsettle the heart.
<br>

<br>
	- Death
<br>

<br>
		- Just... haunted recently.
<br>

<br>
		- Lots of thoughts about Grammy, Will. 
<br>

<br>
		- That's okay. I do miss them both.
<br>

<br>
		- I will go one day as well, but that's not my problem as soon as it happens.
<br>
- We want to cluster news articles intelligently. 
<br>

<br>
- What if we made an assumption about news carriers.
<br>

<br>
	- A carrier will not simultaneously run 2 stories on the same topic.
<br>

<br>
		- Therefore each story is its own topic
<br>

<br>
		- Therefore there are no inside-publisher clusters.
<br>

<br>
		- But you can cluster across the divide. Figure out which one is closest and if it is indeed close. The expectation should be 1-1-1 across clusters. It's easier to assume that they have the same biases and be proven wrong than the alternative.
<br>

<br>
		- [x] Modify the rss feed output to include source info.
<br>

<br>
		- [x] make a clusterer on this topic. (matmul only, max axis=0, i think.) (already used it once with axis=0. Unclear if it works or not)
<br>

<br>
		- [x] Make the whole document again, big style. Feed it to claude and get the summary it would make, then make whatever nonsense one on your own as necessary.
<br>

<br>
		- [x] italics it not `<it> blocks </it>` but `<i>italics</i>`
<br>

<br>
		- perhaps a better flow would have been to establish things with prompts then ask claude itself to translate them to code that does things in this way. 
<br>

<br>
- I want, yearn for things now. I want that job. I want to work on AI, I want to be a part of it all. I don't know why, precisely. I don't know what's an interview and what doesn't count. Maybe I am being and can be the person I want to be, who would push all those things with at least that much intention.
<br>

<br>
- Maybe I should give up and move to the west coast. Maybe I will move there in my 50s and lament that I would have found it fun all along. I will have wanted to. The man who imagines the city as a youth but only visits as an old man. desire is only a memory.
<br>

<br>
	- I need to read invisible cities again.
<br>

<br>
- THE BOT WORKS AGAIN! It just needed the copilot app user agent string `CopilotNative/1.25082.74.0-prod WindowsPicassoSdk/1.25082.74.0 (Windows 11 10.0.26100.0; .Net 9.0.3; X64)` 
<br>

<br>
	- Also hitting up the start and activate endpoints to appear more legitimate.
<br>

<br>
	- Still can't quite get the clarity version running but that user agent string is important.
<br>

<br>
- [ ] For next week, think about the following:
<br>

<br>
	- [ ] strategy doc re ltae? 
<br>

<br>
		- What would it contain? 
<br>

<br>
			- specifying the goal of the effort.
<br>

<br>
			- What have we tried in the past
<br>

<br>
			- what have we learned in the past.
<br>

<br>
			- What's different now? How the strategy is changing going forward
<br>

<br>
				- Tunings, etc.
<br>

<br>
			- How do we intend to measure?
<br>

<br>
			- Rough timeline.
<br>

<br>
		- Run by the team, esp RT, DB. Get ideas. 
<br>

<br>
		- Make sure everyone is on the same page.
<br>

<br>
		- something like a paper for the first study to justify the second, etc. 
<br>

<br>
		- Maybe WHALE, etc. 
<br>

<br>
	- [ ] If we want to make a team. How's the temperature for the team?
<br>

<br>
	- [ ] A 4th thought? What's my scope? Long term experiments. 
<br>

<br>
		- Then what? Coalesced Id??
<br>

<br>
- Finished Sebald's _The Rings of Saturn_. It wandered so aggressively and had so much beauty to show off. It animated the history of those dilapidated places. Beautiful. 
<br>

<br>
- 
<br>
- [x] water garden manual areas. 
<br>

<br>
- Bought L the Fuji instant camera. R the circuit mess communicator diy.

- [Cognitive Workspace: Active Memory Management for LLMs -- An Empirical Study of Functional Infinite Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13171)
	 - arXiv:2508.13171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and ...
- [Search-Time Data Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13180)
	 - arXiv:2508.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or...
- [QuickMerge++: Fast Token Merging with Autoregressive Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13204)
	 - arXiv:2508.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck. While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static, modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed fo...
- [SPANER: Shared Prompt Aligner for Multimodal Semantic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13387)
	 - arXiv:2508.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result, modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER),...
- [Breaking the SFT Plateau: Multimodal Structured Reinforcement Learning for Chart-to-Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13587)
	 - arXiv:2508.13587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient, highligh...
- [Revisiting RAG Ensemble: A Theoretical and Mechanistic Analysis of Multi-RAG System Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13828)
	 - arXiv:2508.13828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on ...
- [Contextual Attention-Based Multimodal Fusion of LLM and CNN for Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13196)
	 - arXiv:2508.13196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management. Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately, our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing, lever...
- [Hierarchical Conformal Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13288)
	 - arXiv:2508.13288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledg...
- [Decoding Communications with Partial Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13326)
	 - arXiv:2508.13326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby po...
- [X-MoE: Enabling Scalable Training for Emerging Mixture-of-Experts Architectures on HPC Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13337)
	 - arXiv:2508.13337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication. Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs - perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant c...
- [Dimension lower bounds for linear approaches to function approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13346)
	 - arXiv:2508.13346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note presents a linear algebraic approach to proving dimension lower bounds for linear methods that solve $L^2$ function approximation problems. The basic argument has appeared in the literature before (e.g., Barron, 1993) for establishing lower bounds on Kolmogorov $n$-widths. The argument is applied to give sample size lower bounds for kernel methods.
- [Adaptive Conformal Prediction Intervals Over Trajectory Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13362)
	 - arXiv:2508.13362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectori...
- [Decentralized Contextual Bandits with Network Adaptivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13411)
	 - arXiv:2508.13411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored in networked environments when information is partially share...
- [MAVIS: Multi-Objective Alignment via Value-Guided Inference-Time Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13415)
	 - arXiv:2508.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives -- such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alig...
- [SVDformer: Direction-Aware Spectral Graph Embedding Learning via SVD and Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13435)
	 - arXiv:2508.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-awar...
- [Bounding Causal Effects and Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13607)
	 - arXiv:2508.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice. Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied wo...
- [Text2Weight: Bridging Natural Language and Neural Network Weight Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13633)
	 - arXiv:2508.13633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integr...
- [Explainable Learning Rate Regimes for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13639)
	 - arXiv:2508.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD), whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated aut...
- [GRAFT: Gradient-Aware Fast MaxVol Technique for Dynamic Data Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13653)
	 - arXiv:2508.13653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-...
- [MACTAS: Self-Attention-Based Module for Inter-Agent Communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13661)
	 - arXiv:2508.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, a...
- [DREAMS: Preserving both Local and Global Structure in Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13747)
	 - arXiv:2508.13747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS, PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure pr...
- [Fisher-Orthogonal Projection Methods for Natural Gradient Descent with Large Batches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13898)
	 - arXiv:2508.13898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory, enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global minimum. ...
- [Convergent Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Stochastic Shortest Path Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13963)
	 - arXiv:2508.13963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose two algorithms in the tabular setting and an algorithm for the function approximation setting for the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem. SSP problems form an important class of problems in Reinforcement Learning (RL), as other types of cost-criteria in RL can be formulated in the setting of SSP. We show asymptotic almost-sure convergence for all our algorithms. We observe superior performance of our tabular algorithms...
- [AutoScale: Linear Scalarization Guided by Multi-Task Optimization Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13979)
	 - arXiv:2508.13979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO ...
- [Learning from Preferences and Mixed Demonstrations in General Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14027)
	 - arXiv:2508.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale. We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational...
- [Preference Models assume Proportional Hazards of Utilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13189)
	 - arXiv:2508.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approaches for estimating preferences from human annotated data typically involves inducing a distribution over a ranked list of choices such as the Plackett-Luce model. Indeed, modern AI alignment tools such as Reward Modelling and Direct Preference Optimization are based on the statistical assumptions posed by the Plackett-Luce model. In this paper, I will connect the Plackett-Luce model to another classical and well known statistical model, the...
- [Online Conformal Selection with Accept-to-Reject Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13838)
	 - arXiv:2508.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting a subset of promising candidates from a large pool is crucial across various scientific and real-world applications. Conformal selection offers a distribution-free and model-agnostic framework for candidate selection with uncertainty quantification. While effective in offline settings, its application to online scenarios, where data arrives sequentially, poses challenges. Notably, conformal selection permits the deselection of previously...
- [Generalisation and benign over-fitting for linear regression onto random functional covariates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13895)
	 - arXiv:2508.13895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretical predictive performance of ridge and ridge-less least-squares regression when covariate vectors arise from evaluating $p$ random, means-square continuous functions over a latent metric space at $n$ random and unobserved locations, subject to additive noise. This leads us away from the standard assumption of i.i.d. data to a setting in which the $n$ covariate vectors are exchangeable but not independent in general. Under an assu...
