        "summary": "Welcome to the LGBTQIA+ News Post for June 30. Sorry about the delay; the Skrmetti case demoralized me for a while. But we will survive! . The Bad News With the recent Supreme Court decision that national injunctions issued by courts aren't legal, the head of the Regime has decided that means he can use it to shove his agenda through , including all of the anti-trans orders. Because of course he will take any opportunity to abuse those his backers find make them feel weird. The Regime's Ministry of Education, under former WWE executive Linda McMahon, also issued a decision that California's trans-inclusive student athlete policy is in violation of Title IX anti-discrimination laws . Again. As part of the resolution, California has been ordered to revoke its inclusive policies within 10 days, adopt a binary biological definition of sex, and retroactively amend records and awards to reflect this definition or risk losing federal education funding. \n\n[...]\n\nCalifornia officials have defended their stance, citing the state's long-standing legal and ethical commitment to equality for all students, including trans youth. If at first you don't succeed, I guess the Regime's goons are gonna keep sucking until they do suck seed. This is in the wake of California Gov. Gavin Newsom calling these accusations from the MoE as \" dramatic, fake, and completely divorced from reality \" BAH GAWD, IT'S GAVIN NEWSOM IN THE RING WITH A STEEL CHAIR! Secretary of Beer Drinking Defense Pete Hegseth stated that he was changing the name of the USNS Harvey Milk for the purposes of \"taking the politics out of ship naming\" and noting that they'd name a ship after Milk if he had been \"discharged honorably\". Milk, a former Navy diver, was received an other-than-honorable discharge when it was discovered that he was gay. I'm waiting for his reasons for the renaming of all the other ships he's announced would be renamed. This comes on the heels of a press conference he had an absolute meltdown at , where he accused reporters of \"cheering against Trump,\" dismissed intelligence leaks as politically motivated, and lashed out at questions about gender representation in the military as \"little games.\" Having to be sober sucks for you, eh, Petey? The Supreme Court is preparing to move forwards or, you know, backwards with nine petitions with implications for transgender rights , including trans athlete bans for West Virginia, Idaho, and Arizona; bans on gender affirming surgery covered under Medicare in West Virginia and Idaho; North Carolina's ban on gender affirming care in the state employee insurance plan; and Oklahoma's ban on updating their sex designation to match their gender identity. None of these were covered by the decision in Skrmetti , so now they are slavering with glee hoping for resolutions.\n\nOver in South Carolina, the city of Columbia had a ban on conversion therapy put into place in 2021. After a firmly wordered threatening letter to pull state funding if elected from gubernatorial candidate - and current state Attorney General - Alan Wilson (R, unsurprisingly) - the mayor and half the city council removed the ban , with the other 3 members of the city council voting against removing the ban. Why did they vote to remove it? Partially because of the threat, and partially because no one had been charged with violating the ban during its lifetime , which seems to me to be high on the list of stupid reasons .\n\nThis past weekend, New Hampshire representatives sent a trans youth care ban to Governor Kelly Ayotte. Ayotte has not said if she will sign. This is the first one passed since the Supreme Courth's deeply partisan and ideological decision on Skrmetti .\n\nIn Michigan, a group of unpleasant and prejudiced men at the University of Michigan have filed a federal lawsuit claiming discrimination . The group, Faculty, Alumni, & Students Opposed to Racial Preferences (FASORP), claim in the suit that University and the Michigan Law Review discriminate based on \"race and sex preferences\" to select members. FASORP also sued Northwestern University in January, alleging that the Northwestern University Law Review there openly discriminated by \"hiring women and racial minorities with mediocre and undistinguished records over white men who have better credentials, better scholarship, and better teaching ability.\"\n\nThe latest lawsuit against the University of Michigan said practices at the Law Review changed in recent years based on practices of \"left-wing students and affirmative-action devotees.\" It focuses more on discrimination related to sexual orientation and gender identity, and claims applicants to the Law Review were encouraged to identify those attributes in personal statements even though the institution legally cannot ask applicants to identify those attributes. There are a bunch of trees making oxygen for these guys, and those trees deserve apologies. In the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has urged public bodies currently not enforcing the Supreme Court's gender ruling to bar trans people from single-sex spaces \"as soon as possible\". How do the shoes of the TERFs taste, Keir? In the meantime, a poll in the UK says that if the election that got Keir in power was held today, the Reform party (formerly the Brexit Party) headed by Nigel \"Sir Oswald Moseley's Best Fanboy\" Farage would get 271 seats in Parliament , which seems akin to voting for the NDSAP in 1933 .\n\nPolice Scotland has stated that trans women will have their bodies searched by male officers . right, so that leaves Ireland safe enough, but nothing else. In Indonesia, police arrested 75 people for attending a \"gay party\" in a privately rented villa outside Jakarta. They were arrested on violations of Indonesia's Pornography Law, which defines pornography as encompassing material that contravenes \"norms of community morality\" without defining it better, letting the possibilites of arrests become wider. The Good News Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Susan \"Very Concerned\" Collins (R-Me) have re-introduced the Refund Equality Act, which would allow same-sex couples to amend tax returns back to when they were married . It's coming alongside Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR)'s Equal Dignity for Married Taxpayers Act, which Senator Warren co-sponsors, which if passed would protect LGBTQ+ Americans from inequality and discrimination by removing gender-specific references to marriage in the tax code. Collins and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) also reintroduced the Jury ACCESS (Access for Capable Citizerns and Equality in Service Selection) Act to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of protected characteristics in jury selection.\n\nBooksmith, a bookstore in San Francisco, announced they would no longer sell any H-rry P-tt-r books, based on the cruelty of J. K. Fouling Rowling.\n\nThe governor of the state of Delaware, Matt Meyer, has signed an executive order declaring it a sanctuary state for the LGBTQIA+ community !\n\nNew York City mayoral candidate and top target of the \"Why Can't They All Be WASPs?\" Agenda Club Zahron Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist has promised to try to do a lot of things to improve the City That Never Sleeps due to too much cocaine on Wall Street, probably , like improving LGBTQ+ health care , make the buses free, cut the real estate tax-free status of NYU and Columbia and use that money to help the City University of New York , tell ICE to go jump off a bridge (I would recommend the Hell Gate Bridge for them), and put rent freezes in place.\n\nOver in the UK, the British Medical Association has passed a motion to support support 'identity-based care' for LGBTQ+ patients , reflecting lived experience and identity above all else. Waiting for the whining from Number 10 Downing Street. The Cinnamon Roll Report In an interview in Vanity Fair , Pedro Pascal had this to say about calling the writer of the wizard kid books a \"fucking loser\" : For his Vanity Fair cover story published Tuesday, Pascal said his comment growing into a larger story made him feel like \"that kid that got sent to the principal's office a lot for behavioral issues in public schools in Texas feeling scared and thinking, 'What'd I do?'\"\n\n\"The one thing that I would say I agonized over a little bit was just, 'Am I helping? Am I fucking helping?'\" he added. \"It's a situation that deserves the utmost elegance so that something can actually happen, and people will actually be protected. Listen, I want to protect the people I love. But it goes beyond that. Bullies make me fucking sick.\" His sister, Lux Pascal, is going to have her major film debut in the movie Miss Carb\u00f3n, a biography about Carlita Rodr\u00edguez, a trans woman who became the first female coal miner in her hometown of R\u00edo Turbio, Argentina. She also notes that one of her dream roles would be to join the MCU as Jean \"Phoenix\" Grey. (I'd be cool with it!)\n\nBe well, friends. If you have news I missed or personal triumphs, bring them here! We love all our friends. Go on now, go, walk out the door\nJust turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore\nWeren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?\nDid you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?",

        "summary": "On June 20th, World Psychedelics Day , a U.S. Administrative Law Judge released a recommendation to place on Schedule I two psychedelic drugs : DOI and DOC . These drugs are extremely exotic and obscure in terms of human use, but are very important to scientific research, precisely because they are not subject to the onerous requirements of a Schedule I license. This recommendation is the conclusion of a Kafka-esque hearing held last year at DEA headquarters, where a team of scientists organized by Students for Sensible Drug Policy presented their case. Noted psychoactive journalist, chemist, and vocal fryer Hamilton Morris ( previously ) joined SSDP lawyers Brett Phelps and Robert Rush to discuss the case live on YouTube.\nIn short, the hearing set a historic precedent as the first time that scientists were allowed to testify about the potential for drug prohibition to harm scientific research, but this testimony was dismissed as irrelevant because research harm is not one of the eight factors considered when deciding to schedule a drug. Morris had also recorded \"Dispatches from DEA headquarters\" each night after the daily court sessions, and 3 of the 5 podcast episodes are available without a paywall.\nHighlights: There are no verified reports of use of DOI in humans, and the only verified reports for DOC are toxicology reports where DOC was not the only drug present. The DEA used unverified internet postings as proof that DOI and DOC are being abused. Among these was a since-deleted Reddit post where someone claimed to have witnessed 200 people use DOI at a \"parent-teacher conference\". The DEA's star expert witness, Dr. Theresa Carbonaro, testified that obtaining a Schedule I license is not much trouble at all, despite never having obtained one herself. Bizarrely, Carbonaro had previously worked with Dr. Roland Griffiths , whose research is credited with kick-starting the \"psychedelic renaissance\" and who had disclosed how his own personal, extra-legal use of psychedelics had helped him to come to terms with his impending death from cancer. Choice quotes: On cross-examination, Dr. [Alaina] Jaster also stated her sincerely held belief that no drugs should be scheduled under the CSA. Thus, her testimony opposing scheduling of DOI and DOC is a foregone conclusion. While acknowledging the candor of Dr. Jaster's testimony that no drugs should be scheduled, the tribunal must also recognize the purpose of the CSA to schedule drugs, as appropriate. Due to the aforementioned inconsistencies in her testimony and her belief that no drugs should be scheduled, I will consider Dr. Jaster's testimony with reduced weight, especially to the extent that her testimony differs from the testimony of other testifying witnesses on the same subject matter. ... Dr. [Raul] Ramos further testified that \"given [his] two year timeline and two years of funding and all the momentum that [he] would lose, it's quite possible that this scheduling would derail [his] entire research career at Berkeley and cause [him] to not be able to accomplish what [he] need[s] to accomplish in a timely manner and before [his] funding at Berkeley expires.\"",
