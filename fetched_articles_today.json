Axon's Draft One debuted last summer at a police department in Colorado, instantly raising questions about the feared negative impacts of AI-written police reports on the criminal justice system. The tool relies on a ChatGPT variant to generate police reports based on body camera audio, which cops are then supposed to edit to correct any mistakes, assess the AI outputs for biases, or add key context.\n\nBut the EFF found that the tech \"seems designed to stymie any attempts at auditing, transparency, and accountability.\" Cops don't have to disclose when AI is used in every department, and Draft One does not save drafts or retain a record showing which parts of reports are AI-generated. Departments also don't retain different versions of drafts, making it difficult to assess how one version of an AI report might compare to another to help the public determine if the technology is \"junk,\" the EFF said. That raises the question, the EFF suggested, \"Why wouldn't an agency want to maintain a record that can establish the technology's accuracy?\"",

      "summary": "Welcome to the LGBTQIA+ News Post for July 11. It's been a while, but I know you wanted me to stay . I just want to let people know that part of the delay was a need to wait for some money to get Pepto-Bismol so I could deal with the nausea .\n\nSome Housekeeping before getting started: it was made known to me that screen readers do not deal with strikethroughs well at all. I was unaware of this, and apologize to anyone that had an issue as the result. I won't be using them anymore, instead putting my sarcasm and anger out in the open like my predecessors in this sort of thing like Jon Stewart and Keith Olbermann. The Bad News Let's get started with the absolute pettiest crap ever. Bethel Church in Crown Point, IN, removed a teen, Bryce Fech, from a position of leadership last year when he came out as gay. His family then left the church. This year, the church called the Christian summer camp Bryce was about to attend to out him - despite his family not being involved in that church anymore - causing the summer camp to inform him that he was not welcome. I mean, seriously, folks, go and show us how there's no hate like \"Christian\" love...\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission hosted what can only be called an anti-trans workshop : FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson framed the event as an investigation into potential \"fraud and deception\" in medical treatment, just weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark U.S. v. Skrmetti ruling upheld Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors. Ferguson also accused the Biden administration of trying to influence the World Professional Association for Transgender Health to make it easier for minors to get hormones and surgeries, and \"declared it the FTC's duty to investigate claims around gender-affirming care.\" One of the speakers also accused Dr. Rachel Levine, who served as assistant secretary for health during the Biden administration, of bringing that political pressure. pausing for a gulp of Pepto. Claiming to be part of the same \"fraud and deception\" investigation, the Department of In Justice has issued subpoenas to doctors and clinics that provide gender-affirming care to minors . I'm sure that this is gonna go well and have no repercussions down the line.\n\nAnd the Department of Ill Health and InHuman Services is now investigating the University of Michigan Health system, based on allegations that the hospital fired a nurse's aide \"for exercising her Federally protected rights of conscience\" by acting, and again I quote, \"against her sincerely held religious convictions and her medical conscience, that she would speak biology-obscuring pronouns and make referrals for 'gender transition' drugs and procedures.\" No Hate Like \"Christian\" Love, Part II.\n\nThe Regime has filed suit against California after the state stated they would not comply with the administration's demands to end their trans-inclusive policy on student sports and enforce bathroom restrictions. The suit includes quotes from Governor Gavin \"All Bets Must Be Hedged\" Newsom's podcast, where he questioned the fairness of letting trans girls compete against cis girls.\n\nThe Department of the Interior has gotten out the scissors again and removed references to bisexuals from Stonewall . How soon until it's just called a riot?\n\nDepartment of Transportation secretary Sean Duffy has sent a letter to all 50 governors, the governor of Puerto Rico, and the mayor of Washington DC, asking them to remove rainbow sidewalks, claiming without evidence that they distract drivers making them crash their cars or hit pedestrians. This is a man who harassed a lesbian for sex on TV, so his opinions are already suspect.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear two challenges to state laws that ban transgender students from participating in girls' and women's sports in its next term . I think we can predict the outcome of this one already.\n\nBaylor University is returning a $643,000 grant to study women and LGBTQ+ people in the church just two weeks after receiving it. As a right-wing evangelical Christian university, they claim it \"extended into advocacy for perspectives on human sexuality that are inconsistent with Baylor's institutional policies.\" I mean, they let Ken Starr be president, only firing him when it was made totally obvious how deliberately he had not investigated sexual assaults, but hey, that's just him making sure \"promising young men\" don't have their careers damaged, right?\n\nAnd the University of Pennsylvania has sold its soul and proven itself to be run by cowards by banning trans athletes and stripping Lia Thomas of all her titles . They claim it was after their Athletic Department's Office of Civil Rights determined doing so was a violation of Title IX regulations. This won't save them.\n\nIn Florida, trans woman Marcy Rheintgen was arrested for using a lavatory for women inside a state building in March, violating the state bathroom ban . She faced 11 months in jail for the violation. As the next part of the story goes: Prosecutors reportedly failed to meet the deadline for filing charging documents against Marcy Rheintgen after she was arrested while protesting the state's anti-trans bathroom ban. A Leon County judge granted her lawyer's motion to dismiss the misdemeanor trespassing charge. Who ran this case, Alina Habba?\n\nRunner Caster Semenya of South Africa has won a case in the European Court of Human Rights , that the Swiss Court of Arbitration violated her rights by holding up the World Athletics decision to disqualify her from events due to her naturally higher testosterone levels. She has been fighting this for seven years, and no longer competes, but is continuing the fight so that it does not affect athletes in the future.\n\nAnd finally, science wants people to know: \"People whose gender identity differs from their birth sex drink more alcohol and engage in more hazardous drinking than cisgender heterosexual peers, according to findings published July 6 in the journal Alcohol: Clinical & Experimental Research .\" (The second link is to the paper in question.) The Good News North Carolina Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat, vetoed three bills that targeted DEI programs and had anti-transgender provisions. Thanks, Josh!\n\nTennis legent Billie Jean King has stated in an interview , \"I don't think people have any idea of how hard it is for trans people,\" King said. \"Just listen to their stories. Listen \u2014 not tell them. Everyone is unique. Make them feel included because you really don't know. With every person I meet, I try to start with a blank. Ask questions.\" Thank you, Billie!\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has stated they will start processing cases of gender identity discrimination again , claiming they will process cases that \"fall squarely\" under the 2020 Bostock v Clayton County decision. Hopefully they really will!\n\nThe Band of The Household Cavalry celebrated Pride in London in a great way: by covering Chappell Roan's \"Pink Pony Club\" in front of Buckingham Palace (YouTube Link to the performance). \n\nRenee Rapp would like to offer you some advice on what to do if you have a homophobic parent .\n\nAnd a big thank you to rrrrrrrrrt for this bit of happy news: Same-sex penguin couple raising rare chick at U.K. zoo . All cheer Scampi and Flounder! The Cinnamon Roll Report \"Lesbian Jesus\" Hayley Kiyoko has reportedly gotten engaged to her longtime partner Becca Tilley. The former Wizards of Waverly Place star and performer of lesbian anthem \"Girls Like Girls\" posted pictures on Instagram (as you do) and they look very happy.\n\nAnd since this IS the CRR, you know who I have to mention: On the red carpet in Berlin for the premiere of Fantastic Four: First Steps, he said : \"It's important to protect people, especially those simply asking for the right to exist in bodies that belong to them and in the world that they never asked to be brought into.\n\n\"It's a very, very small, vulnerable, inspiring, courageous and brave community that fills me with a lot of inspiration. Therefore, it's very important to protect that. They would do that for us.\" Be well, friends. If you have news I missed or personal triumphs, bring them here! Let us know your joys. I thank my wicked dreams, a year from Tennessee\nOh, Santa Monica, you've been too good to me\nWon't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene\nShe sees her baby girl, I know she's gonna scream...",
